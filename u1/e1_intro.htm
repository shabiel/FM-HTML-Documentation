	 <h4><big>VA FileMan Prompts</big></h4> 
	 <h5><big><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>Many VA <acronym title="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</acronym>
     application packages have a <i>scrolling mode</i> interface. Scrolling mode
		works as follows: </p> 
	 <ol> 
		<li>The computer puts a prompt on your screen.<br><br></li> 
		<li>You enter a response to the prompt.<br><br></li> 
		<li>The computer places another prompt on the screen, scrolling down one
		  line. Previous prompts move up and eventually off of your screen. </li> 
	 </ol> 
	 <p>In scrolling mode, prompting occurs in the same predetermined order, in
		a sequence designed by the developer of the application. You enter and the
		computer stores your responses one at a time. And, unless you're familiar with
		a few timesaving scrolling mode techniques, you have to step through each
		prompt in a record before you can finish editing the record. </p> 
	 <p>Recently developed <acronym title="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</acronym>
     applications often use a <i>screen-oriented</i> interface (i.e., Screen Mode)
		for editing data. However, Scrolling Mode interfaces are still used quite
		heavily in <acronym title="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</acronym>
     applications. </p> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> For more information on Screen Mode, please refer to the
		"<a href="sm_frm.htm" target="_top" title="ScreenMan" class="bodylink">ScreenMan</a>" chapter in this manual.</p> 
	 <p>After reading about a few of the scrolling mode operations discussed in
		this chapter, you should be able to enter and edit data in scrolling mode with
		a minimum number of keystrokes. </p> <hr align="center" width="90%"> 
	 <h5><big><a name="ret">The  Key</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>To enter data in scrolling mode, you primarily enter data or commands at
		a prompt on your terminal screen. After typing a command or data at your
		terminal keyboard, you must send your response from your terminal to the
		computer. Pressing the Enter or Return key on your keyboard (abbreviated as
		<b></b> in examples) sends all of your typed input to the computer
		for action or storage. </p> 
	 <p>If you type a response but fail to press the Enter/Return key, the
		computer waits; it won't do anything until you tell it you've finished entering
		your response. Pressing the Enter/Return key also tells the computer when
		you've decided to "enter" nothing at all. Whenever you press the Enter/Return
		key without first entering data or a command, you tell the computer either to
		avoid taking action or to take the default action at the current prompt. The
		computer then moves on to the next prompt. </p> <hr align="center" width="90%">
	 
	 <h5><a name="structure">S<big>tandard Prompt Structure</big></a></h5> 
	 <p>The standard VA FileMan prompt consists of three parts: </p> 
	 <p align="center"><img src="e1_1.gif" alt="Example Showing the Components of a Prompt and the User's Response." height="319" width="440"> </p>
	 <hr align="center" width="90%"> 
	 <h5><big><a name="responding">Responding to Prompts</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>When VA FileMan prompts you for a response, typically a colon
		("<b>:</b>") is used at the end of the prompt; the computer waits for a
		response. Prompts are often asking for the value of a field in a file, like the
		one shown below: </p> 
	 <pre>    DATE OF BIRTH:</pre> 
	 <p>This type of prompt is waiting for you to enter a value, like <b>3 OCT
		49</b>. Don't forget to complete your interaction by pressing the Enter/Return
		key (<a href="#ret" title="Return Key Topic" class="bodylink"><b></b></a>). </p> 
	 <p>If the answer to the prompt question is a choice of several things, the
		prompt often starts with the word "Select", as in: </p> 
	 <pre>    Select PATIENT NAME: </pre> 
	 <p>If the question requires either a YES or NO response (in which case
		simply Y or N, upper- or lowercase, is acceptable), the prompt may end with a
		question mark, rather than by a colon: </p> 
	 <pre>    ARE YOU SURE?  </pre> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> For more information on the specific types of fields
		(DATE/TIME, NUMERIC, WORD-PROCESSING, FREE TEXT, etc.) and how to edit them,
		please refer to the "<a href="he_frm.htm" target="_top" title="About Each Field Type" class="bodylink">About Each Field Type</a>"
		chapter in this manual.</p> <hr align="center" width="90%"> 
	 <h5><big><a name="help">Getting Online Help at Any Prompt (Enter ? or
		??)</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>If you're not sure how to answer a prompt, Help is always available.
		Just enter one question mark ("<b>?</b>") to get brief help, or two question
		marks ("<b>??</b>") to get more detailed online help: </p>

	 </tbody></table> 
	 <p></p> <hr align="center" width="90%"> 
	 <h5><big><a name="incorrect">Incorrect Responses</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>VA FileMan checks each answer to a prompt immediately after you enter
		it. If you answer a prompt incorrectly, VA FileMan "beeps," and displays two
		spaces and two question marks. You may be given an explanation of what was
		incorrect. Then, you're given a chance to respond to the prompt again. </p>
	 <hr align="center" width="90%"> 
	 <h5><big><a name="partial">Partial Responses</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>When you are choosing one of a set of responses, you can save keystrokes
		by not typing the full response. Type in only the first letter of first few
		letters representing the response that you desire. If the characters you enter
		uniquely identify one of the possible acceptable responses, VA FileMan "echoes
		back" the remaining characters and uses the matching choice as your
		response.</p> 
	 <p>If more than one possible answers begin with the character(s) that you
		typed, VA FileMan displays the possible choices in a list, and asks you to
		choose which choice you want by number: </p> 
	 <p align="center"><img src="e1_2.gif" alt="Example of Choosing from a List When Making a Partial Response." height="142" width="606"> </p>
	 <hr align="center" width="90%"> 
	 <h5><big><a name="default">Default Responses</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>When you're working in <acronym title="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</acronym>
     applications, the computer frequently present a <i>default</i> answer along
		with a prompt. This answer is built into the application program and represents
		the most probable response to the prompt that is being asked. These default
		answers are clearly identified by the double slash marks that follow them
		("<b>//</b>"). If the default answer that is provided is correct, you need only
		press the Enter/Return key to accept it.</p> 
	 <p>For example:</p> 
	 <pre>    SSN: 123123124// </pre> 
	 <p>In this case, if you press the Enter/Return key, 123123123 is posted as
		your response to this prompt. </p> 
	 <p>If, on the other hand, the default answer isn't what you need, enter the
		correct information at the prompt. For example: </p> 
	 <pre>    SSN: 123123124// <b>089234563 </b></pre> 
	 <p>When editing data stored in fields, defaults are used to present the
		current value of the field. As with any default prompt, if you just press the
		Enter/Return key, the current value of the field is left unchanged. To change
		the value of the field, enter a new value and press the Enter/Return key.</p>
	 <hr align="center" width="90%"> 
	 <h5><big><a name="replace_with">Longer Default Responses and the "Replace &#8230;
		With" Editor</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>When a default is 20 or more characters in length, it won't be followed
		by double slashes ("<b>//</b>"). Instead, it is presented with a "Replace"
		prompt:</p> 
	 <pre>    ADDRESS 1: 301 Bayshore Boulevard  Replace </pre> 
	 <p>The "Replace" prompt employs the "Replace...With" Editor. At the
		"Replace" prompt, you can revise some or all of the existing default answer. To
		revise only a piece of the existing default response, type in any series of
		letters that are part of the existing default answer that you want to change
		and then press the Enter/Return key. At the "With" prompt, enter the series of
		characters to replace the original series, and press the Enter/Return key. At
		this point, the "Replace" prompt is presented again, so that you can enter
		additional corrections. If you're all done, however, just press the
		Enter/Return key to finish working in the field and move on to the next
		prompt.</p> 
	 <p>For example:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>ADDRESS 1: 301 Bayshore Boulevard  Replace <b>Bay </b> With <b>North<br></b>
    Replace <b></b>
        301 Northshore Boulevard
    ADDRESS 2:
</pre> <hr> 
	 <p>To replace the entire default answer at a "Replace...With" prompt,
		simply enter three periods ("<b>&#8230;</b>"), called an ellipsis, at the
		"Replace" prompt. You are then able to replace the entire default with what you
		enter at the "With" prompt:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>ADDRESS 1: 301 Bayhshore Boulevard  Replace <b>... </b> With <b>301<br>Folsom Street </b>
      Replace <b></b>
       301 Folsom Street
    ADDRESS 2:
</pre> <hr> 
	 <p>If you want to delete the entire text, enter the at-sign ("<b>@</b>") at
		the "Replace" prompt: </p> 
	  
	 <pre>ADDRESS 1: 301 Bayshore Boulevard  Replace <b>@ </b>
        SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE? <b>Y </b>  (Yes)<br>    ADDRESS 2:<br></pre> <hr> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> The at-sign ("<b>@</b>") is the command in many places to
		signal deletion, as you'll learn later in this chapter. </p> 
	 <p><b>"Replace..." Prompt Shortcuts</b></p> 
	 <p>The following table illustrates shortcut responses when entering data at
		the "Replace" prompt:</p>

	 <h5><big><a name="list_prompts">Prompts with a List of Choices</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>If the acceptable answer to a field prompt is one of a set of choices,
		you can display the list of choices by entering one or two question marks. If
		that set of choices is short enough to be displayed on five or six lines, the
		choices are listed when you enter a single question mark.</p> 
	 <p>Here's an example.</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select PATIENT NAME: <b>?</b>
    ANSWER WITH PATIENT NAME 
    CHOOSE FROM:   
     ADAMS,JOHN 
     BROWN,SANDRA 
     DOE,JOE 
    Answer must be 3-30 characters in length.

    Select PATIENT NAME:
</pre> <hr> 
	 <p>When you enter a question mark ("<b>?</b>") and the entry list is long,
		you're asked if you want to see all the entries. Besides a YES or NO response,
		you can enter an up-arrow ("<b>^</b>") followed by a string of characters to
		see a list of all entries beginning with the one that starts with those
		characters. </p> 
	 <p>The following example shows selection of an entry starting with an alpha
		character.</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select PATIENT NAME: <b>? </b>  <br>    ANSWER WITH PATIENT NAME, OR SSN <br>    DO YOU WANT THE ENTIRE 1890-ENTRY PATIENT LIST? <b>^S </b> <br>    CHOOSE FROM: <br>     SAINT,JOSEPH <br>     SALTER,PAUL <br>     SAMSON,JOHN <br>     SANCHEZ,JOSE <br>      '^' TO STOP  <b>^ </b>
 
      YOU MAY ENTER A NEW PATIENT, IF YOU WISH 
     Enter patient name in "Last, First Middle" format [3-30 characters]. 

    Select PATIENT NAME:
</pre> <hr> 
	 <p>If you know the list is long and still want it to be displayed, you can
		enter <i>two</i> question marks ("<b>??</b>") to force the display of the
		entire list. </p> <hr align="center" width="90%"> 
	 <h5><big><a name="key_fields">Key Fields</a>&nbsp;</big></h5> 
	 <p>During a data entry session, VA FileMan checks that the combination of
		fields that make up a key for a record is unique for all records in the file.
		If a single field makes up a key, VA FileMan checks for uniqueness as soon as
		that field is edited. If more than one field makes up a key (compound key), VA
		FileMan checks that the combination of new key field values is unique only at
		the end of the data entry session (unless otherwise instructed by the
		programmer). If a compound key is <i>not</i> unique, VA FileMan restores the
		fields that make up the key to their pre-edited values, and prints a message.
		</p> 
	 <p>For example:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select ZZTEST NAME: <b>`16 </b>  SMITH,JOHN  9900  SEP 03, 1932<br>ID NUMBER: 9900// <b>9800</b>
DATE: SEP 3,1932// <b>1/21/1932 </b>  (JAN 21, 1932)<br><br>*****  NOTE  *****<br><br>Some of the previous edits are not valid because they create one or more<br>duplicate keys.  Some fields have been restored to their pre-edited<br>values.<br><br>Do you want to see a list of those fields? YES// <b></b>

The following field(s) have been restored to their pre-edited values:

File: ZZTEST File (#16999)
  Key: A
    Record: 'SMITH,JOHN' (#16)

              Field: ID NUMBER(#1)
      Invalid value: 9800
        Restored to: 9900

              Field: DATE (#2)
      Invalid value: JAN 21, 1932
        Restored to: SEP 03, 1932
</pre> <hr> <hr align="center" width="90%"> 
	 <h4><big><a name="special">Special Responses to Field Prompts</a></big></h4> 
	 <h5><big><a name="deleting">Deleting a Field's Value ("@")</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>When you want to delete an answer previously entered, without
		substituting any other answer, enter an at-sign ("<b>@</b>") as a response to
		that prompt: </p> 
	 <pre>    DATE OF BIRTH:  May 21, 1946// <b>@ </b>
    SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE? <b>YES</b></pre> 
	 <p>In this example, the date on file would be erased: there is no answer to
		the DATE OF BIRTH question; its value is now null. You're asked to confirm the
		deletion; this gives you a chance to change your mind before deleting the
		field. </p> <hr align="center" width="90%"> 
	 <h5><big><a name="jumping">Jumping to Another Field with the Up-Arrow
		("^")</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>If you fail to notice a typing error until after you've pressed the
		Enter/Return key and stored a field, you can still correct this error. What you
		need to do is go back to the field where the error occurred. You can usually
		accomplish this by using the <i>jump</i> command. This command requires
		entering an up-arrow ("<b>^</b>") along with the name, or first few letters, of
		the field to which you wish to jump. Instead of moving to the next prompt, you
		jump to the prompt you identified, as shown below:</p> 
	 <pre>    SSN:  123123123//  <b>^DATE OF BIRTH </b>
    DATE OF BIRTH:</pre> 
	 <p>To get a list of the fields to which you can jump, enter an up-arrow and
		a question mark ("<b>^?</b>") at any field prompt.</p> 
	 <p>You can use the up-arrow to jump both forward and backward in a sequence
		of fields.</p> 
	 <p><b>TIP:</b> Sometimes, you may only need to update one field in a
		record. You can jump directly to that field once you start to edit that record.
		This can save time; you don't need to go through every field and prompt that
		precedes the one you want! </p> <hr align="center" width="90%"> 
	 <h5><big><a name="up-arrow">Exiting with the Up-Arrow ("^")</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>To exit or opt out of answering any question or prompt, enter the
		up-arrow ("<b>^</b>") by itself at the field prompt, as in the example below:
		</p> 
	 <pre>    SSN: 123123123// <b>^</b> <br>    Select PATIENT NAME:</pre> 
	 <p>In the previous example, the field value 123123123 remains unchanged,
		but you skip the rest of the questions for this record and return to the
		"Select..." prompt. If you enter an up-arrow ("<b>^</b>") at the "Select..."
		prompt, you return to the previous prompt, and so on.</p> 
	 <p>Entering the up-arrow ("<b>^</b>") by itself to exit a given function is
		a convention used throughout <acronym title="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</acronym>
     applications.</p> <hr align="center" width="90%"> 
	 <h5><big><a name="up-arrow2">Exiting with the Up-Arrow ("^^")</a> &nbsp;</big></h5> 
	 <p>When the user is doing a lookup to the file, VA FileMan may search many
		indexes looking for a value that matches the users input. This can be time
		consuming. If the user wants to get out of the lookup before VA FileMan has
		completed the search, the user can enter "<b>^^</b>" at any prompt. </p>
	 <hr align="center" width="90%"> 
	 <h5><big><a name="mandatory">Mandatory (Required) Fields</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>In some cases a field is <i>mandatory</i>, and you <i>must</i> enter a
		value, if one isn't already there; in other words, a null response (i.e.,
		pressing the Enter/Return key without making an entry) is not valid. When you
		use the up-arrow ("<b>^</b>") or press the Enter/Return key without entering
		data in one or more fields in the entry, your terminal "beeps" and prompts you
		again to enter information.</p> 
	 <p>If you don't fill in all required fields in a record, it is considered
		incomplete, and won't be stored unless you fill in the required fields. This
		protects the database from records containing so little information that they
		are useless. Enter the requested information.</p> 
	 <p>If you still need to exit before you can provide all required
		information, you should abort your edit and start over later. You can usually
		exit out of the data editing sequence by answering any of the prompts with an
		up-arrow ("<b>^</b>").</p> <hr align="center" width="90%"> 
	 <h5><big><a name="spacebar">Spacebar Recall</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>VA FileMan can recall your most recent response to a prompt. This
		feature is called spacebar recall and employs the Spacebar
		(<b>&lt;Space&gt;</b>) and Enter/Return (<b></b>) keys. For example,
		if you are editing a particular patient in a Nursing application and then
		switch to the Order/Entry application to work with the same patient, you can
		usually retrieve the same patient by pressing the Spacebar and the Enter/Return
		keys at the second application's (Order/Entry) "Select PATIENT NAME:"
		prompt.</p> 
	 <p>For example:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select PATIENT NAME: <b>&lt;Space&gt;</b>
      DOE,JOHN
    NAME: DOE,JOHN//
</pre> <hr> 
	 <p><b>Tip:</b> You can use spacebar recall throughout VA FileMan and the
		Kernel. Experiment with this feature as a quick way to recall your last
		response to most prompts.</p> <hr align="center" width="90%"> 
	 <h5><big><a name="session">Typical Data Entry Session</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>So far we have discussed responding to individual prompts. Here is an
		example of a typical data entry session. The example is characteristic of
		editing data in many <acronym title="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</acronym>
