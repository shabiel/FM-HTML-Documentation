	 <P>Many VA <ACRONYM
		 TITLE="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</ACRONYM>
     application packages have a <I>scrolling mode</I> interface. Scrolling mode
		works as follows: </P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>The computer puts a prompt on your screen.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>You enter a response to the prompt.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>The computer places another prompt on the screen, scrolling down one
		  line. Previous prompts move up and eventually off of your screen. </LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P>In scrolling mode, prompting occurs in the same predetermined order, in
		a sequence designed by the developer of the application. You enter and the
		computer stores your responses one at a time. And, unless you're familiar with
		a few timesaving scrolling mode techniques, you have to step through each
		prompt in a record before you can finish editing the record. </P> 
	 <P>Recently developed <ACRONYM
		TITLE="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</ACRONYM>
     applications often use a <I>screen-oriented</I> interface (i.e., Screen Mode)
		for editing data. However, Scrolling Mode interfaces are still used quite
		heavily in <ACRONYM
		TITLE="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</ACRONYM>
     applications. </P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> For more information on Screen Mode, please refer to the
		"<A HREF="sm_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" TITLE="ScreenMan"
		CLASS="bodylink">ScreenMan</A>" chapter in this manual.</P> 
	 <P>After reading about a few of the scrolling mode operations discussed in
		this chapter, you should be able to enter and edit data in scrolling mode with
		a minimum number of keystrokes. </P> <HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="90%"> 
	 <H5><A NAME="ret">The &lt;RET&gt; Key</A></H5> 
	 <P>To enter data in scrolling mode, you primarily enter data or commands at
		a prompt on your terminal screen. After typing a command or data at your
		terminal keyboard, you must send your response from your terminal to the
		computer. Pressing the Enter or Return key on your keyboard (abbreviated as
		<B>&lt;RET&gt;</B> in examples) sends all of your typed input to the computer
		for action or storage. </P> 
	 <P>If you type a response but fail to press the Enter/Return key, the
		computer waits; it won't do anything until you tell it you've finished entering
		your response. Pressing the Enter/Return key also tells the computer when
		you've decided to "enter" nothing at all. Whenever you press the Enter/Return
		key without first entering data or a command, you tell the computer either to
		avoid taking action or to take the default action at the current prompt. The
		computer then moves on to the next prompt. </P> <HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="90%">
	 
	 <H5><A NAME="structure">Standard Prompt Structure</A></H5>

	 <H5><A NAME="responding">Responding to Prompts</A></H5> 
	 <P>When VA FileMan prompts you for a response, typically a colon
		("<B>:</B>") is used at the end of the prompt; the computer waits for a
		response. Prompts are often asking for the value of a field in a file, like the
		one shown below: </P> 
	 <PRE>    DATE OF BIRTH:</PRE> 
	 <P>This type of prompt is waiting for you to enter a value, like <B>3 OCT
		49</B>. Don't forget to complete your interaction by pressing the Enter/Return
		key (<A HREF="#ret" TITLE="Return Key Topic"
		CLASS="bodylink"><B>&lt;RET&gt;</B></A>). </P> 
	 <P>If the answer to the prompt question is a choice of several things, the
		prompt often starts with the word "Select", as in: </P> 
	 <PRE>    Select PATIENT NAME: </PRE> 
	 <P>If the question requires either a YES or NO response (in which case
		simply Y or N, upper- or lowercase, is acceptable), the prompt may end with a
		question mark, rather than by a colon: </P> 
	 <PRE>    ARE YOU SURE?  </PRE>

		spaces and two question marks. You may be given an explanation of what was
		incorrect. Then, you're given a chance to respond to the prompt again. </P>

	 <P>When you are choosing one of a set of responses, you can save keystrokes
		by not typing the full response. Type in only the first letter of first few
		letters representing the response that you desire. If the characters you enter
		uniquely identify one of the possible acceptable responses, VA FileMan "echoes
		back" the remaining characters and uses the matching choice as your
		response.</P> 
	 <P>If more than one possible answers begin with the character(s) that you
		typed, VA FileMan displays the possible choices in a list, and asks you to

	 <P>When you're working in <ACRONYM
		 TITLE="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</ACRONYM>
     applications, the computer frequently present a <I>default</I> answer along
		with a prompt. This answer is built into the application program and represents
		the most probable response to the prompt that is being asked. These default
		answers are clearly identified by the double slash marks that follow them
		("<B>//</B>"). If the default answer that is provided is correct, you need only
		press the Enter/Return key to accept it.</P> 
	 <P>For example:</P> 
	 <PRE>    SSN: 123123124// </PRE> 
	 <P>In this case, if you press the Enter/Return key, 123123123 is posted as
		your response to this prompt. </P> 
	 <P>If, on the other hand, the default answer isn't what you need, enter the
		correct information at the prompt. For example: </P> 
	 <PRE>    SSN: 123123124// <B>089234563 &lt;RET&gt;</B></PRE> 
	 <P>When editing data stored in fields, defaults are used to present the
		current value of the field. As with any default prompt, if you just press the
		Enter/Return key, the current value of the field is left unchanged. To change
		the value of the field, enter a new value and press the Enter/Return key.</P>
	 <HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="90%"> 
	 <H5><A NAME="replace_with">Longer Default Responses and the "Replace &#133;
		With" Editor</A></H5> 
	 <P>When a default is 20 or more characters in length, it won't be followed
		by double slashes ("<B>//</B>"). Instead, it is presented with a "Replace"
		prompt:</P> 
	 <PRE>    ADDRESS 1: 301 Bayshore Boulevard  Replace </PRE> 
	 <P>The "Replace" prompt employs the "Replace...With" Editor. At the
		"Replace" prompt, you can revise some or all of the existing default answer. To
		revise only a piece of the existing default response, type in any series of
		letters that are part of the existing default answer that you want to change
		and then press the Enter/Return key. At the "With" prompt, enter the series of
		characters to replace the original series, and press the Enter/Return key. At
		this point, the "Replace" prompt is presented again, so that you can enter
		additional corrections. If you're all done, however, just press the
		Enter/Return key to finish working in the field and move on to the next
		prompt.</P> 
	 <P>For example:</P> 
	 <PRE>
</PRE> <HR> 
	 <PRE>ADDRESS 1: 301 Bayshore Boulevard  Replace <B>Bay &lt;RET&gt;</B> With <B>North
&lt;RET&gt;</B>
    Replace <B>&lt;RET&gt;</B>
        301 Northshore Boulevard
    ADDRESS 2:
</PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>To replace the entire default answer at a "Replace...With" prompt,
		simply enter three periods ("<B>&#133;</B>"), called an ellipsis, at the
		"Replace" prompt. You are then able to replace the entire default with what you
		enter at the "With" prompt:</P>

	 <P>During a data entry session, VA FileMan checks that the combination of
		fields that make up a key for a record is unique for all records in the file.
		If a single field makes up a key, VA FileMan checks for uniqueness as soon as
		that field is edited. If more than one field makes up a key (compound key), VA
		FileMan checks that the combination of new key field values is unique only at
		the end of the data entry session (unless otherwise instructed by the
		programmer). If a compound key is <I>not</I> unique, VA FileMan restores the
		fields that make up the key to their pre-edited values, and prints a message.

	 <P>If you fail to notice a typing error until after you've pressed the
		Enter/Return key and stored a field, you can still correct this error. What you
		need to do is go back to the field where the error occurred. You can usually
		accomplish this by using the <I>jump</I> command. This command requires
		entering an up-arrow ("<B>^</B>") along with the name, or first few letters, of
		the field to which you wish to jump. Instead of moving to the next prompt, you
		jump to the prompt you identified, as shown below:</P>

	 <P>You can use the up-arrow to jump both forward and backward in a sequence
		of fields.</P> 
	 <P><B>TIP:</B> Sometimes, you may only need to update one field in a
		record. You can jump directly to that field once you start to edit that record.

		</P> 
	 <PRE>    SSN: 123123123// <B>^</B> 
    Select PATIENT NAME:</PRE> 
	 <P>In the previous example, the field value 123123123 remains unchanged,
		but you skip the rest of the questions for this record and return to the
		"Select..." prompt. If you enter an up-arrow ("<B>^</B>") at the "Select..."
		prompt, you return to the previous prompt, and so on.</P> 
	 <P>Entering the up-arrow ("<B>^</B>") by itself to exit a given function is

	 <P>When the user is doing a lookup to the file, VA FileMan may search many
		indexes looking for a value that matches the users input. This can be time
		consuming. If the user wants to get out of the lookup before VA FileMan has
		completed the search, the user can enter "<B>^^</B>" at any prompt. </P>

	 <H5><A NAME="mandatory">Mandatory (Required) Fields</A></H5> 
	 <P>In some cases a field is <I>mandatory</I>, and you <I>must</I> enter a
		value, if one isn't already there; in other words, a null response (i.e.,
		pressing the Enter/Return key without making an entry) is not valid. When you
		use the up-arrow ("<B>^</B>") or press the Enter/Return key without entering
		data in one or more fields in the entry, your terminal "beeps" and prompts you
		again to enter information.</P> 
	 <P>If you don't fill in all required fields in a record, it is considered
		incomplete, and won't be stored unless you fill in the required fields. This
		protects the database from records containing so little information that they
		are useless. Enter the requested information.</P> 
	 <P>If you still need to exit before you can provide all required
		information, you should abort your edit and start over later. You can usually
		exit out of the data editing sequence by answering any of the prompts with an
		up-arrow ("<B>^</B>").</P> <HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="90%"> 
	 <H5><A NAME="spacebar">Spacebar Recall</A></H5> 
	 <P>VA FileMan can recall your most recent response to a prompt. This
		feature is called spacebar recall and employs the Spacebar
		(<B>&lt;Space&gt;</B>) and Enter/Return (<B>&lt;RET&gt;</B>) keys. For example,
		if you are editing a particular patient in a Nursing application and then
		switch to the Order/Entry application to work with the same patient, you can
		usually retrieve the same patient by pressing the Spacebar and the Enter/Return
		keys at the second application's (Order/Entry) "Select PATIENT NAME:"
		prompt.</P> 
	 <P>For example:</P> 
	 <PRE>
</PRE> <HR>

      DOE,JOHN
    NAME: DOE,JOHN//
