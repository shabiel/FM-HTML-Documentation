	 <H5>Fields, Records, and Files</H5> 
	 <P>A computer database such as VA FileMan organizes your data, storing it
		in fields, records, and files, much as you might arrange and preserve
		information on paper. </P> 
	 <P>A <I>record</I> is a group of fields of data. Each record has a name
		(e.g., a patient name for a patient record). You can use the record name to
		recall the record for editing or for printing out. Records are also known as
		file <I>entries</I>.</P> 
	 <P>For example, a record for a patient might have various fields such as
		NAME, AGE, ADMISSION DATE, etc. for a single patient. Each record for a patient
		would contain the same set of fields (places to fill in information):</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="ov_in1.gif" WIDTH="560" HEIGHT="335"
		ALT="Example of Several Records in a Patient File."> </P> 
	 <P>Each <I>field</I> in a record functions just like a blank on a form.
		When you're editing a record on a terminal, for each field, you'll find a
		prompt that tells you what type of data to enter. </P> 
	 <P>VA FileMan uses nine basic field types. These fields allow you to enter
		only certain kinds of information, just as a blank on a form might require you
		to enter only numbers. For example, a DATE OF BIRTH field could be set up to
		record dates/times; a SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER field could be set up to record a
		nine-digit number; an ADDRESS field could be set up to hold the text of an
		address. These three fields are different from one another because of the type
		of data they store. </P> 
	 <P>All of the records that contain like data are collected and stored in
		the same <I>file</I>. For example, all patient records are stored in the
		PATIENT file (#2) and all computer user records are stored in the NEW PERSON
		file (#200). This way, to look up a patient, you know that the file to go to is
		the PATIENT file. Also, to do a report on all patients, you would generate the
		report from the PATIENT file. </P> <HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="90%"> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Database">Files and the Database</A></H5> 
	 <P>The <I>database</I> contains all the data files on your computer system.
		</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="ov_in2.gif" WIDTH="594" HEIGHT="572"
		ALT="Example of Database Files."> </P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> There are many more files than this in <ACRONYM
		 TITLE="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</ACRONYM>
     databases! </P> <HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="90%"> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Printing">Printing Records from Files</A></H5> 
	 <P>One way of getting at the information stored in a database is to
		generate reports that print out selected records. You don't have to print
		<I>every</I> field in a record; you can just choose a subset of fields to print
		out. Nor do you have to print <I>every</I> record in a file; there are ways to
		limit and select what records to print out.</P> 
	 <P>The following report displays four records, with one line of output per
		record, from the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44): </P>

</PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>Most applications that use VA FileMan provide a number of already-set-up
		reports you can quickly choose and print out. In addition, there are options in
		VA FileMan that allow you to generate your own reports. </P> 
	 <P>This manual contains the following chapters on print records from the
		database:</P>

	 <H5><A NAME="Adding">Adding and Editing Records</A></H5> 
	 <P>As well as printing records from the database, you can <I>add</I> new
		records and <I>edit</I> existing records. When you work on the computer system
		with <ACRONYM
		TITLE="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</ACRONYM>
     applications (e.g., Laboratory) most of what you are doing is adding new
		records and editing existing ones. For example, each new lab result would get
		stored in a new record; when you make a status change it would be an edit to a
		field or fields in a patient's existing record.</P> 
	 <P>Since the bulk of the work you do on the computer system involves
		working with records, the more you know about using the underlying database
		system (VA FileMan), the easier it will be do all of your work on the computer
		system.</P>

		records:</P>

	 <H5><A NAME="Laygo">LAYGO</A> File Access</H5> 
	 <P>In <ACRONYM
		 TITLE="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</ACRONYM>
     applications, you not only display and edit existing records, but also add and
		delete records from files. For example, you might need to add a new patient to
		the PATIENT file. The access to add and delete records can be controlled,
		however; each VA FileMan file can be set to either allow or not allow adding
		and deleting of new records. </P> 
	 <P>If a file allows records to be added or deleted, it is said to have
		<I>LAYGO</I> (Learn-As-You-Go) access. To add or delete records, your user
		account must also be set to allow LAYGO access to the file in question. For
		example, there are certain conditions when you need to specify a particular
		physician. At that point, you can enter a new physician name, rather than
		choosing one that already is on file. If you are allowed to add new entries to
		the file (i.e., you have LAYGO access), the new entry is added to a file of
		physicians. </P> <HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="90%"> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Modes">Scrolling Mode vs. Screen Mode</A></H5> 
	 <P>Many VA <ACRONYM
		 TITLE="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</ACRONYM>
     application packages have a <I>Scrolling Mode</I> interface. Scrolling Mode
		works as follows: </P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>The computer puts a prompt on your screen.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>You enter a response to the prompt.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>The computer places another prompt on the screen, scrolling down one
		  line. Previous prompts move up and eventually off of your screen.</LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P>In Scrolling Mode, prompting occurs in the same predetermined order, in
		a sequence designed by the developer of the application. You enter, and the
		computer stores, your responses one at a time. Unless you're familiar with a
		few timesaving Scrolling Mode techniques, you have to step through each prompt
		in a record before you can finish editing the record. </P> 
	 <P>NOTE: For more information on editing records in Scrolling Mode, please
		refer to the "<A HREF="e1_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" TITLE="VA FileMan Prompts"
		CLASS="bodylink">VA FileMan Prompts</A>" chapter in this manual.</P> 
	 <P>Recently developed <ACRONYM
		TITLE="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</ACRONYM>
     applications, on the other hand, often use a <I>Screen Mode</I> interface for
		editing data. In the Screen Mode approach, each field occupies a fixed position
		on the screen. You can see many data fields at once, and use simple key
		combinations to edit data and move from field to field on a screen. You can
		also move from one screen to another like turning through the pages of a book.
		VA FileMan's screen-oriented data entry tool is called
		<A HREF="sm_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" TITLE="ScreenMan"
		 CLASS="bodylink">ScreenMan</A>.</P> 
	 <P>In comparing Scrolling Mode with Screen Mode, an area in particular
		where Screen Mode is much more convenient than Scrolling Mode is text editing.
		VA FileMan's Scrolling Mode text editor is the
		<A HREF="le_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" TITLE="Line Editor" CLASS="bodylink">Line
		Editor</A>. A better choice for editing text is VA FileMan's Screen Mode
		editor, the
		<A HREF="se_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" TITLE="Screen Editor"
		 CLASS="bodylink">Screen Editor</A>. </P>
