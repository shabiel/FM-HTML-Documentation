	 <H4>ScreenMan</H4>
	 <H5><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H5>
	 <P>ScreenMan is VA FileMan's <I>screen-oriented</I> data entry tool. It is
		an alternative to the Scrolling Mode approach. With ScreenMan, data is entered
		in <I>forms</I>. Each form field occupies a fixed position on the screen
		(instead of scrolling off!). You can see many data fields at once, and use
		simple key combinations to edit data and move from field to field on a screen.
		You can also move from one screen to another like turning through the pages of
		a book. </P>
	 <P><B>Similarities with Scrolling Mode Editing</B></P>
	 <UL>
		<LI>You can change a field's value by entering a different value or
		  delete a field's value by entering the at-sign ("<B>@</B>").<BR><BR></LI>
		<LI>You can enter one or two question marks to call up a list of
		  acceptable responses and other help. If you enter a value deemed unacceptable,
		  ScreenMan displays a message explaining what type of information should be
		  entered.<BR><BR></LI>
		<LI>If you wish, you can jump from the current field to any other field
		  in your current screen. With your cursor resting at any field's prompt, simply
		  enter an up-arrow ("<B>^</B>") and then the name of the field. </LI>
	 </UL>
	 <P><B>Differences from Scrolling Mode Editing</B></P>
	 <UL>
		<LI>In Scrolling Mode, you must enter and store your response to one
		  field prompt before you can continue to the next field. In Screen Mode, you can
		  move the cursor from field prompt to field prompt without entering or storing
		  any responses.<BR><BR></LI>
		<LI>In Scrolling Mode, your data values or responses to field prompts are
		  stored one at a time, as you move from prompt to prompt. In Screen Mode, your
		  responses to most prompts are stored only when you exit the form.</LI>
    <li><span class="badge">22.2</span>The “Customize Colors” suboption within ScreenMan allows selection of
      ANSI colors for all ScreenMan presentations, on a parameterized basis
      (user, institution, etc.) using Kernel parameters.</li>
    <li><span class="badge">22.2</span>The ScreenMan Record Selection page can now be a full ScreenMan page
      using a computed multiple pointer so that the user can select an entry
      by scrolling up or down. This new feature lets forms contain embedded
      lookups.</li>
    <li><span class="badge">22.2</span>You can set this up automatically when you create a form. At the query
      “Do you want you’re Form to begin with a display of all entries, for
      selection,” answer “Yes.” The initial position can be set to be the user’s
      last selection, rather than first, last, or new.</li>
    <li><span class="badge">22.2</span>ScreenMan does support the use of a mouse for emulators that support
        ANSI standard control sequences to turn the mouse on and off. However,
        the Department of Veterans Affairs has elected to turn this feature off
        due to support complications with Attachmate Reflection. The parameter
        DI SCREENMAN NO MOUSE needs to be established for SYSTEM and set to
        “Yes”.</li>
	 </UL>
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> For a detailed explanation on <I>creating</I> ScreenMan
		forms, please refer to the "ScreenMan Tutorial for Developers Manual" --
		available in both Adobe Acrobat PDF and HTML formats on the

	 <P></P>
	 <P>Fields are usually composed of a <I>data element</I> and a
		<I>caption</I>. ScreenMan displays data elements in high intensity (boldface)
		and other text in regular intensity. Text that identifies a data element is
		called a <I>caption</I> and is usually followed by a colon ("<B>:</B>"). A
		caption and its associated data element are together called a <I>field</I>.
		Captions of <I>required</I> fields are underlined; to save any changes you make
		on the form, required fields <I>must</I> contain data. </P>
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> ScreenMan highlights captions for required fields with an
		underline. However, on some terminals or depending on your terminal emulator
		software and your personal preferences, the form of the highlight can vary
		(e.g., some emulators will highlight required fields in a different color, with
		an underline, or both). <BR> <BR> Specifically, on Qume 102 and Wyse 75
		terminals, captions for required fields display in boldface, not underlined.
		Also, the edit window is displayed with an underline extending from the last
		character of the existing data to the right edge of the edit window. FileMan
    supports longer than 24 line screens for those using terminal emulators.</P>

	 <P>There are a number of ways you can move the cursor from field to field
		on a form (i.e., navigate). This is to provide you with as much flexibility as
		possible so that you can work quickly and efficiently with forms.</P>

	 <P><B>Adding a New Entry to a Multiple</B></P>
	 <P>You can respond to a Multiple field in one of two ways: </P>
	 <UL>
		<LI>Accept the field's default answer.<BR><BR></LI>
		<LI>Enter a new item: an employee's second address, for example, or
		  another admission date for the same patient. </LI>
	 </UL>
	 <P>Sometimes, you may need to enter a new entry in a Multiple. To do this,
		enter the new value for the new entry in the Multiple's .01 field. If you have
		LAYGO access (permission to add new entries), you'll be asked if you want to
		add the entry to the Multiple. To change your mind about adding the item, enter
		NO. If you enter YES, though, ScreenMan opens either a "pop-up" page or a new
		window, allowing you to enter additional information for the new Multiple
		entry. </P>
	 <P><B>Multiples in Repeating Blocks</B></P>
	 <P>Subrecords in a Multiple can be displayed in another way. Rather than
		just the name of single entry in the Multiple being displayed on the current
		page, you may also see Multiples where several Subrecords are displayed
		simultaneously on the page. Each Subrecord occupies one line on the screen, in
		a scrolling list. This is called a repeating block. Instead of leading to a
		"pop-up" page, you are able to edit all visible fields in the Multiple as they
		are displayed. </P>
	 <P>For example:</P>
	 <P></P>
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="sm_3.gif" WIDTH="594" HEIGHT="340"
		ALT="Example of a Multiple Subrecord Displayed in ScreenMan."> </P>
	 <P></P>
	 <P>You can always navigate to a blank line below the end of the list. At
		this blank line, you can add a new Subrecord if LAYGO is allowed, or jump to an
		existing Subrecord by entering its name. </P>
	 <P><B>Navigational Keys for Repeating Blocks</B></P>

	 <H5><A NAME="Filed">How to File Edits</A></H5>
	 <P>In general, the database is unaffected while you edit a record in a
		ScreenMan form. Changes are filed only at your request, when you
		<A HREF="#save" TITLE="SAVE" CLASS="bodylink">SAVE</A> or
		<A HREF="#exit" TITLE="EXIT" CLASS="bodylink">EXIT</A>. </P>
	 <P>Before filing, ScreenMan checks that: </P>
	 <UL>
		<LI>Required fields on all pages that can be accessed via the next and
		  previous page links have values, even if you have not accessed those pages
		  during the editing session.<BR><BR></LI>
		<LI>If you have accessed any subpages, required fields in those subpages
		  must also have values. </LI>
	 </UL>
	 <P>If any required field is empty, you cannot file any data changes. When
		you attempt to file, ScreenMan displays a list of those fields that require
		values. </P>
	 <P>The <B>&lt;PF1&gt;Q</B> key sequence allows you to
		<A HREF="#quit" TITLE="Quit" CLASS="bodylink">quit</A> the form without saving
		changes. Filing does not occur if you time out. </P>
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> There is one situation in which a change to the database is
		made immediately: when you delete an entry from a file or subfile. When you
		attempt to delete an entry, ScreenMan issues a warning that deletions are
		immediate and permanent. Even if you
		<A HREF="#quit" TITLE="Quit" CLASS="bodylink">quit</A> the form without
		<A HREF="#save" TITLE="Saving" CLASS="bodylink">saving</A> your changes, the
		entry is not restored to the database.</P> <HR>
	 <H5><A NAME="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</A></H5>
	 <P>While screen displays offer many advantages, they also require that the
		software can correctly identify the type of terminal being used or emulated. An
		incorrect identification may produce unreadable and unusable screens. To exit
		such a screen, enter <B>^&lt;RET&gt;^&lt;RET&gt;</B>. </P>
	 <P>If you continue to find the screens are unreadable, check the following
		sources for troubleshooting information: </P>

		  User Manual" (e.g., the "<A HREF="../u2/pm_dev.htm" TARGET="display"
