<h4>ScreenMan</h4>
<h5><big><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></big></h5>
<p>ScreenMan is VA FileMan's <i>screen-oriented</i>
data entry tool. It is an alternative to the Scrolling Mode approach.
With ScreenMan, data is entered in <i>forms</i>. Each form
field occupies a fixed position on the screen (instead of scrolling
off!). You can see many data fields at once, and use simple key
combinations to edit data and move from field to field on a screen. You
can also move from one screen to another like turning through the pages
of a book. </p>
<p><b>Similarities with Scrolling Mode Editing</b></p>
<ul>
<li>You can change a field's value by entering a different
value or delete a field's value by entering the at-sign ("<b>@</b>").<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>You can enter one or two question marks to call up a list
of acceptable responses and other help. If you enter a value deemed
unacceptable, ScreenMan displays a message explaining what type of
information should be entered.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>If you wish, you can jump from the current field to any
other field in your current screen. With your cursor resting at any
field's prompt, simply enter an up-arrow ("<b>^</b>") and
then the name of the field. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Differences from Scrolling Mode Editing</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In Scrolling Mode, you must enter and store your response
to one field prompt before you can continue to the next field. In
Screen Mode, you can move the cursor from field prompt to field prompt
without entering or storing any responses.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>In Scrolling Mode, your data values or responses to field
prompts are stored one at a time, as you move from prompt to prompt. In
Screen Mode, your responses to most prompts are stored only when you
exit the form.</li>
<li><span class="badge">22.2</span>The
“Customize Colors” suboption within ScreenMan allows selection of ANSI
colors for all ScreenMan presentations, on a parameterized basis (user,
institution, etc.) using Kernel parameters.</li>
<li><span class="badge">22.2</span>The
ScreenMan Record Selection page can now be a full ScreenMan page, so
that the user can select an entry by
scrolling up or down.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="badge">22.2</span>
You can
set this up automatically when you create a form. At the query “Do you
want you’re Form to begin with a display of all entries, for
selection,” answer “Yes.” The initial position can be set to be the
user’s last selection, rather than first, last, or new.</li>
<li><span class="badge">22.2</span>
ScreenMan
does support the use of a mouse for emulators that support xterm-like
standard control sequences to turn the mouse on and off. However, the
Department of Veterans Affairs has elected to turn this feature off due
to support complications with Attachmate Reflection.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> For a detailed explanation on <i>creating</i>
ScreenMan forms, please refer to the "ScreenMan Tutorial for Developers
Manual".</p>
<hr>
<h5><big><a name="Screen"> The ScreenMan Screen</a></big></h5>
<p></p>
<center> <img src="sm_1.gif" alt="Example of the ScreenMan Screen." border="0" height="429" width="624"> </center>
<p></p>
<p>Fields are usually composed of a <i>data element</i>
and a <i>caption</i>. ScreenMan displays data elements in
high intensity (boldface) and other text in regular intensity. Text
that identifies a data element is called a <i>caption</i>
and is usually followed by a colon ("<b>:</b>"). A caption
and its associated data element are together called a <i>field</i>.
Captions of <i>required</i> fields are underlined; to save
any changes you make on the form, required fields <i>must</i>
contain data. </p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> ScreenMan highlights captions for
required fields with an underline. However, on some terminals or
depending on your terminal emulator software and your personal
preferences, the form of the highlight can vary (e.g., some emulators
will highlight required fields in a different color, with an underline,
or both). <br>
<br>
Specifically, on Qume 102 and Wyse 75 terminals, captions for required
fields display in boldface, not underlined. Also, the edit window is
displayed with an underline extending from the last character of the
existing data to the right edge of the edit window. FileMan supports
longer than 24 line screens for those using terminal emulators.</p>
<hr>
<h5><a name="Fields">How to Navigate Between Fields</a></h5>
<p>There are a number of ways you can move the cursor from field
to field on a form (i.e., navigate). This is to provide you with as
much flexibility as possible so that you can work quickly and
efficiently with forms.</p>
<p>You can use the keystrokes listed in the following table to
move the cursor to various fields located on a ScreenMan form:</p>
<table summary="ScreenMan Field Navigation Table" title="ScreenMan Field Navigation Table" border="1" width="100%">

<p></p>
<hr>
<h5><big><a name="Pages">How to Navigate Between Pages</a></big></h5>
<p>Many ScreenMan forms have more than one <i>page</i>
(i.e., there are additional screens besides the first one on the form)
with additional fields that you can edit.</p>
<p>You can use the keystrokes listed in the following table to
move between pages on a ScreenMan form:</p>
<table summary="ScreenMan Page Navigation Table" title="ScreenMan Page Navigation Table" border="1" width="100%">

<p></p>
<hr>
<h5><big><a name="Saving">Saving and Exiting</a></big></h5>
<p>To SAVE or EXIT the form, you need to reach ScreenMan's
command line. It's reachable from any ScreenMan screen. To reach the
command line, do any one of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Enter an up-arrow ("<b>^</b>") at any field
prompt.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Press <b></b>, <b>&lt;Tab&gt;</b>,
or <b>&lt;PF4&gt;</b> to move from field to field
until you reach the command line.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Press <b>&lt;ArrowDown&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;ArrowUp&gt;</b>
to move the cursor from field to field downwards or upwards, until you
reach the command line. </li>
</ul>
<p>Then you can enter SAVE or EXIT at the <a href="#Command" title="Command Line Options" class="bodylink">command
line</a> (see below).</p>
<hr>
<h5><big><a name="Command">Command Line Options</a>
(SAVE, EXIT, etc.)</big></h5>
<p>From the Command Line, you can issue the commands to perform
various functions while in ScreenMan. You can also use a shortcut key
sequence to perform the same function without having to enter it on the
command line.</p>
<p><b>Shortcut Keys</b></p>
<p>The following table illustrates the command line options and
the corresponding shortcut responses when entering data in a ScreenMan

<p></p>
<p>If the first key you press upon navigating to a field is a
printable character, the Field Editor assumes you want to replace any
existing default and replaces the entire field with the character just
typed. To just edit the existing field value, first press an editing
key, such as <b>&lt;ArrowLeft&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;ArrowRight&gt;</b>.
</p>
<hr>
<h5><big><a name="Long">Long Fields (and the Zoom Editor)</a></big></h5>
<p>The actual contents of a field being edited can extend beyond
the confines of the visible field on a ScreenMan form. As you use the <b>&lt;ArrowLeft&gt;</b>
and <b>&lt;ArrowRight&gt;</b> keys at the left and
right edges of the window, you can scroll left or right to display one
end or the other of the field. </p>
<p>To see and edit the entire contents of a long field at once,
press <b>&lt;PF1&gt;Z</b> to invoke the Zoom
Editor. This opens an area up at the bottom of the screen, providing
you as much space as you need to both see and edit the entire long
field.</p>
<hr>
<h5><big><a name="Wp">Word-processing Fields</a></big></h5>
<p>To
edit or display a WORD-PROCESSING field, press the Enter/Return key at
the WORD-PROCESSING field. This clears the screen and passes control to
your Preferred Editor to edit the field. If you do not have a Preferred
Editor, the Screen Editor is used. When you exit the editor, you return
to the ScreenMan screen.&nbsp;</p><p> <span class="badge">22.2</span>
If
the field contains data (one or
more
lines), you will see a "+" at the point where the cursor stops by the
Word-Processing field's caption. </p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> To set your Preferred Editor, please
refer to the "<a href="wp_swit.htm" title="Choice of Word-processing Editors" class="bodylink">Choice
of Word-processing Editors</a>" chapter in this manual.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> If the WORD-PROCESSING field is
uneditable or appears in a display block, you can view the contents of
the field with an editor. However, if you edit the text, your changes
will <i>not</i> be filed in the permanent database, even
if you tell the editor to save the changes.</p>
<hr>
<h5><big><a name="Multiples">Multiples</a></big></h5>
<p>You can easily spot a Multiple field. It usually begins with
the word "Select" (as in "Select ADDRESS" or "Select ADMISSION DATE").
There are two ways Multiples can be displayed on a form: </p>
<ul>
<li>The Multiple is linked to a "pop-up" subpage, which
contains the subfields of the Multiple.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The Multiple is displayed in a repeating block -- several
Subrecords can be displayed simultaneously on a page, much like a
scrolling list.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Multiples Linked to "Pop-Up" Subpages</b></p>
<p>A Multiple field can appear on a page and be linked to a
regular or "pop-up" subpage. When you navigate to the Multiple field,
select a Subrecord, and press the Enter/Return key, you are taken to
the subpage, which contains the fields within the Multiple.</p>
<p>In the following illustration, the Multiple is the field with
the caption "Select EMPLOYMENT HISTORY:". When you enter "FEB 1,1950"
at this field, you are taken into a "pop-up" subpage, where you can
edit the fields for that particular Subrecord.</p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><img src="sm_2.gif" alt="Example of a ScreenMan Popup Subpage." height="379" width="595"> </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Exiting a Subpage</b></p>
<p>While in a subpage, your only Command Line options are <a href="#close" title="CLOSE" class="bodylink">CLOSE</a>
and <a href="#refresh" title="REFRESH" class="bodylink">REFRESH</a>. You cannot <a href="#exit" title="EXIT" class="bodylink">EXIT</a>,
<a href="#quit" title="Quit" class="bodylink">Quit</a>,
or <a href="#save" title="SAVE" class="bodylink">SAVE</a>
until you return to the parent page. You can return to the parent page
by pressing <b>&lt;PF1&gt;C</b> or issuing the <a href="#close" title="CLOSE" class="bodylink">CLOSE</a>
command at the Command Line. From there, you can select another
Subrecord to edit or navigate to another field.</p>
<p><b>Deleting an Entry in a Multiple</b></p>
<p>If a default Subrecord is displayed at a Multiple field, you
can delete that Subrecord by entering an at-sign ("<b>@</b>")
at the Multiple field. You can also delete a specific Subrecord by
selecting that Subrecord and going into the subpage, and entering an
at-sign ("<b>@</b>") at the .01 field. </p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Deletions of Subrecords are immediate
and permanent even if you quit the form without saving, deleted
Subrecords are not restored to the database.</p>
<p><b>Adding a New Entry to a Multiple</b></p>
<p>You can respond to a Multiple field in one of two ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>Accept the field's default answer.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Enter a new item: an employee's second address, for
example, or another admission date for the same patient. </li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, you may need to enter a new entry in a Multiple. To
do this, enter the new value for the new entry in the Multiple's .01
field. If you have LAYGO access (permission to add new entries), you'll
be asked if you want to add the entry to the Multiple. To change your
mind about adding the item, enter NO. If you enter YES, though,
ScreenMan opens either a "pop-up" page or a new window, allowing you to
enter additional information for the new Multiple entry. </p>
<p><b>Multiples in Repeating Blocks</b></p>
<p>Subrecords in a Multiple can be displayed in another way.
Rather than just the name of single entry in the Multiple being
displayed on the current page, you may also see Multiples where several
Subrecords are displayed simultaneously on the page. Each Subrecord
occupies one line on the screen, in a scrolling list. This is called a
repeating block. Instead of leading to a "pop-up" page, you are able to
edit all visible fields in the Multiple as they are displayed. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><img src="sm_3.gif" alt="Example of a Multiple Subrecord Displayed in ScreenMan." height="340" width="594"> </p>
<p></p>
<p>You can always navigate to a blank line below the end of the
list. At this blank line, you can add a new Subrecord if LAYGO is
allowed, or jump to an existing Subrecord by entering its name. </p>
<p><b>Navigational Keys for Repeating Blocks</b></p>
<p>The following table illustrates the keystrokes you use to
navigate while in a Repeating Block in a ScreenMan form:</p>

<h5><big><big><a name="Filed">How to File Edits</a></big></big></h5>
<p>In general, the database is unaffected while you edit a record
in a ScreenMan form. Changes are filed only at your request, when you <a href="#save" title="SAVE" class="bodylink">SAVE</a>
or <a href="#exit" title="EXIT" class="bodylink">EXIT</a>.
</p>
<p>Before filing, ScreenMan checks that: </p>
<ul>
<li>Required fields on all pages that can be accessed via the
next and previous page links have values, even if you have not accessed
those pages during the editing session.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>If you have accessed any subpages, required fields in those
subpages must also have values. </li>
</ul>
<p>If any required field is empty, you cannot file any data
changes. When you attempt to file, ScreenMan displays a list of those
fields that require values. </p>
<p>The <b>&lt;PF1&gt;Q</b> key sequence
allows you to <a href="#quit" title="Quit" class="bodylink">quit</a> the form without saving
changes. Filing does not occur if you time out. </p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> There is one situation in which a
change to the database is made immediately: when you delete an entry
from a file or subfile. When you attempt to delete an entry, ScreenMan
issues a warning that deletions are immediate and permanent. Even if
you <a href="#quit" title="Quit" class="bodylink">quit</a>
the form without <a href="#save" title="Saving" class="bodylink">saving</a> your changes, the entry is
not restored to the database.</p>

<h5><big><big><a name="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></big></big></h5>
<p>While screen displays offer many advantages, they also require
that the software can correctly identify the type of terminal being
used or emulated. An incorrect identification may produce unreadable
and unusable screens. To exit such a screen, enter <b>^^</b>.
</p>
<p>If you continue to find the screens are unreadable, check the
following sources for troubleshooting information: </p>
<ul>
<li>"<a href="../u2/pm_frm.htm" target="_top" title="System Management" class="bodylink">System
Management</a>" chapter of the "VA FileMan Advanced User Manual"
(e.g., the "<a href="../u2/pm_dev.htm" target="display" title="Device Handling for Standalone VA FileMan" class="bodylink">Device Handling for Standalone VA FileMan</a>"
topic).<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>"Kernel Systems Manual" (look for information on "Device
Type at Sign-on" and changing your terminal type).<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Your system manager.</li>
</ul>
