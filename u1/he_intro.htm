	 <h4>About Each Field Type</h4> 
	 <h5><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h5> 
	 <p>So far, you've been introduced to several fundamental VA FileMan
		conventions, including: </p> 
	 <ul> 
		<li>When the cursor comes to rest in a field, the computer expects you to
		  respond.<br><br></li> 
		<li>A field serves much the same purpose as a blank on a
		  form.<br><br></li> 
		<li>Each field has a prompt that identifies your response's subject
		  matter.<br><br></li> 
		<li>You have a number of tools available to you at field prompts,
		  including the up-arrow ("<b>^</b>") jump, default response, "Replace...With"
		  editor, spacebar recall, and at-sign ("<b>@</b>") deletion.<br><br></li> 
		<li>Some fields have additional restrictions, such as your response's
		  length or format. Enter a single or two question marks ("<b>?</b>" or
		  "<b>??</b>") to retrieve Help on what is an acceptable entry for a particular
		  field.</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <p>When you are editing a field, entering a question mark ("<b>?</b>") at
		the field prompt usually provides enough help to infer what kind of field
		you've reached and to predict what kind of data is acceptable in this field.
		</p> 
	 <p>You won't need to know a lot about these field types, but a little
		information can be helpful. In the pages that follow, you'll find examples and
		brief explanations about each field type (i.e., DATA TYPE). In VA FileMan,
		you'll work with many, if not all, of the following field types: </p> 
	 <ul> 
		<li><a href="#date" title="DATE/TIME" class="bodylink">DATE/TIME</a><br><br></li> 
		<li><a href="#numeric" title="NUMERIC" class="bodylink">NUMERIC</a><br><br></li>

	 <p>In addition,
		<a href="#subfiles" title="Subfiles (Multiples)" class="bodylink">Subfiles
		(Multiples)</a> are introduced at the end of this chapter.</p> <hr> 
	 <h4><a name="date">DATE/TIME Fields</a></h4> 
	 <p>You can use a variety of formats when entering dates. For example, a
		DATE/TIME field would probably be used to hold a patient's birthdate: </p> 
	 <pre>    DATE OF BIRTH: MAR 3, 1955</pre> 
	 <p>With the DATE/TIME field type, as with all field types, entering a
		question mark retrieves Help on acceptable responses. Enter a single question
		mark ("<b>?</b>") at a DATE/TIME field prompt and you'll be given Help about
		what dates are acceptable for the particular field and what precision of date
		is needed (year, month, day, or time). </p> 
	 <p><b>Acceptable Formats for Entering Dates</b></p> 
	 <ul> 
		<li>JULY 20, 1999 <u>or</u> July 20, 1999<br><br></li> 
		<li>7/20/99<br><br></li> 
		<li>20 JUL 99<br><br></li> 
		<li>10jul99<br><br></li> 
		<li>10 jul 99<br><br></li> 
		<li>072099</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <p>To simplify entering dates, you can use shortcuts such as <b>T</b> for
		today, <b>T-1</b> for yesterday, or <b>T+1</b> for tomorrow. Or you can combine
		<b>T</b> with <b>D</b> for day, <b>W</b> for week, or <b>M</b> for month;
		<b>T-2D</b> means two days ago, <b>T+1W</b> means today plus one week, and
		<b>T+4M</b> means four months from today. </p> 
	 <p>The year portion of the date can be left off. Normally, VA FileMan
		assumes the current year. Sometimes, you can input imprecise dates such as "JUL
		99" or "1999".</p> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> VA FileMan is Year 2000 (Y2K) compliant.</p> 
	 <p><b>Abbreviations for Dates</b></p> 
	 <p>The following table illustrates acceptable abbreviations when entering
		dates:</p> 
	 <table summary="Abbreviations for Dates Table" title="Abbreviations for Dates Table" border="1" width="100%"> 
		<tbody><tr> 
		  <td width="288"><b>Abbreviation</b></td> 
		  <td width="139"><b>Meaning</b> </td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td width="288"><b>TODAY</b> or <b>Today</b> or <b>T</b> or <b>t</b>
			 </td> 
		  <td width="139">Today.</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td width="288"><b>TODAY+1</b> or <b>T+1</b> or <b>t+1</b></td> 
		  <td width="139">Tomorrow.</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td width="288"><b>TODAY-7</b> or <b>T-7</b> or <b>t-7</b></td> 
		  <td width="139">One week ago.</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td width="288"><b>TODAY+3W</b> or <b>T+3W</b> or <b>t+3w</b></td> 
		  <td width="139">Three weeks hence.</td> 
		</tr> 
	 </tbody></table> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p><b>Times in DATE/TIME Fields</b></p> 
	 <p>In some DATE/TIME fields, you can enter a time-of-day along with the
		date. For example, to indicate 4:00 PM on July 20, 1999, enter the date in one
		of the formats shown above, followed by an at-sign ("<b>@</b>"), followed by
		the time. </p> 
	 <p>For example, you might enter:</p> 
	 <pre>    APPOINTMENT: <b>20 JUL 99@4PM</b></pre> 
	 <p>To be totally unambiguous, you can enter time as military time (four or
		six digits, no colon), hour AM/PM, hour:minute AM/PM, or hour:minute:second
		AM/PM. If you do omit an AM/PM notation, the following assumptions are
		made:</p> 
	 <ul> 
		<li>If you enter a single digit for the hour, a time between 6AM and 6PM
		  is used. Thus, <b>T@330</b> (or <b>T@3:30</b>) means today at 3:30 PM and
		  <b>T@945</b> (or <b>T@9:45</b>) means today at 9:45 AM.<br><br></li> 
		<li>If you enter two digits for the hour, the actual hour entered is used
		  (as if military time were being used). Thus, <b>T@0330</b> (or <b>T@03:30</b>)
		  means today at 3:30 AM. </li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <p>As with dates, there are supported abbreviations you can use when
		entering times in DATE/TIME fields. For example, to enter the present moment,
		you can enter the word <b>NOW</b>. To enter an hour from the present moment,
		enter <b>NOW+1H</b>. To enter an hour ago from the present moment, enter
		<b>NOW-1H</b>. You can also combine <b>NOW</b> with <b>D</b> for day and
		<b>M</b> for month and <b>'</b> (apostrophe) for minute.&nbsp;<img src="new.gif" alt="New/Updated with VA FileMan V. 22.0 with Patch DI*22*36" border="0" height="11" width="35"> &nbsp;And you can enter <b>MID</b> for 12
		a.m. and <b>NOON</b> for 12 p.m.</p> 
	 <p><b>Abbreviations for Times</b></p> 
	 <p>The following table illustrates acceptable abbreviations when entering
		time: </p> 
	 <table summary="Abbreviations for Times Table" title="Abbreviations for Times Table" border="1" width="100%"> 
		<tbody><tr> 
		  <td width="139"><b>Abbreviation</b></td>

	 <h4><a name="numeric">NUMERIC Fields</a></h4> 
	 <p>NUMERIC-type fields work very much like
		<a href="#free" title="FREE TEXT" class="bodylink">FREE TEXT</a> fields, except
		that input is restricted to valid numbers. There can also be restrictions as to
		how small or large a number is allowed, and how many decimal places are
		allowed. Entering a question mark retrieves Help that tells you what responses
		are acceptable. </p> 
	 <p>For example, a NUMERIC field would probably be used to store the height
		of a patient: </p> 
	 <pre>    HEIGHT (cm): 196 </pre> <hr> 
	 <h4><a name="set">SET OF CODES Fields</a></h4> 
	 <p>SET OF CODES-type fields (sometimes referred to as a SET) are preset to
		accept coded information. The codes are usually only one or two characters
		long. Each code in a SET represents a word or a series of words. The codes Y
		and N, for example, often represent the words YES and NO. You can enter the
		code at this prompt instead of the entire word. If, however, you enter anything
		other than an acceptable code (or the word it represents), the computer will
		reject your response. </p> 
	 <p>To see a list of acceptable codes, simply enter a question mark in
		response to the prompt. </p> 
	 <p>The following example shows how a SET OF CODES field is used to store
		whether or not a patient is a smoker: </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p align="center"><img src="he_1.gif" alt="Example of the Valid Choices in a SET OF CODES Field." height="127" width="577"> </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p><b>Internal vs. External Values for SET OF CODES Fields</b></p> 
	 <p>In the previous example, the value of the SMOKER field is set to N,
		which is the code for NON-SMOKER. In this case, N is the internal value of the
		field (the form in which it is stored in the database). NON-SMOKER is the
		external value of the field (the form in which it is displayed on screen and in
		reports). </p> 
	 <p>Every DATA TYPE has an internal and external value; in most cases,
		however, the internal and external values are the same. SET OF CODES fields are
		an exception. </p> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> Probably, the only place you need to know the distinction
		between internal and external values is when you print a report and <i>sort</i>
		on a SET OF CODES field. The sort order is based on the internal values (codes)
		if you sort on a SET OF CODES field. <br> <br> For more information on printing
		and sorting, please refer to the "<a href="pr_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Print" class="bodylink">Print</a>" chapter in this manual. </p> <hr> 
	 <h4><a name="free">FREE TEXT Fields</a></h4> 
	 <p>You can enter almost any character from your keyboard in a FREE
		TEXT-type field. The computer accepts numbers, letters, and most of the symbols
		that can be entered. The FREE TEXT field places a restriction on the number of
		characters that you can enter. If you enter a question mark ("<b>?</b>") in
		response to the prompt for a FREE TEXT field, you'll learn how many characters
		you are allowed to enter. </p> 
	 <p>For example, a FREE TEXT field would probably be used to hold a
		patient's street address: </p> 
	 <pre>    ADDRESS: 235 Begonia Street</pre> 
	 <p>In some places, even though the field is FREE TEXT, checks are applied
		to make sure what is entered matches a certain format. For example, if you're
		entering a Social Security Number (which is stored as a FREE TEXT, <i>not</i>
		NUMERIC, field), your input would typically be checked to make sure it is nine
		characters in length, and contains all digits: </p> 
	  
	 <pre>SSN: <b>abcde </b>  ??<br>     ANSWER MUST BE 9 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH<br>    SSN: <b>99999 </b>  ??<br>      ANSWER MUST BE 9 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH<br>    SSN: <b>33233290 </b>  ??<br>      ANSWER MUST BE 9 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH<br>    SSN: <b>034232343 </b>
    DATE:
</pre> <hr> 
	 <p></p><hr> 
	 <h4><a name="word">WORD-PROCESSING Fields</a></h4> 
	 <p>Fields with a WORD-PROCESSING DATA TYPE can contain unlimited amounts of
		text data, and are suitable for things like mail messages, physician notes, and
		descriptions. Because of their special nature, VA FileMan provides special
		tools for entering and editing data into this kind of a field. </p> 
	 <p>Two editors for editing WORD-PROCESSING fields are provided with VA
		FileMan (and described in their own chapters in this manual):</p> 
	 <ul> 
		<li><a href="se_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Screen Editor" class="bodylink">Screen Editor</a><br><br></li> 
		<li><a href="le_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Line Editor" class="bodylink">Line Editor</a></li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <p>You can <i>set</i> your default editor; see the "<a href="wp_swit.htm" title="Choice of Word Processing Editors" class="bodylink">Choice of Word
		Processing Editors</a>" chapter. This chapter also explains how you can switch
		your current editor on the fly. For most people, the Screen Editor should be
		your Preferred Editor for WORD-PROCESSING fields. </p> 
	 <p>When you encounter a WORD-PROCESSING field, if your default editor is
		the <a href="se_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Screen Editor" class="bodylink">Screen Editor</a>, a portion of any existing text is
		displayed, and you'll be prompted "Edit? NO//":</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select PATIENT NAME: <b>SAMPLE,FRED A.</b>
NAME: SAMPLE,FRED A.// <b></b> <br>SEX: MALE// <b></b> <br>DATE OF BIRTH: AUG 22,1948// <b></b> <br>HISTORY: <br>Owing to poverty in early youth, patient seems not to<br>have had proper diet. Since achieving economic success,<br>his diet has been adequate, but traces of original<br>deficiency remain.<br> <br>  Edit? NO//<br></pre> <hr> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> For a guide to using the Screen Editor, please refer to the
		<a href="se_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Screen Editor" class="bodylink">Screen Editor</a> chapter in this manual. </p> 
	 <p>When you encounter a WORD-PROCESSING field, if your default editor is
		the <a href="le_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Line Editor" class="bodylink">Line Editor</a> on the other hand, a portion of the text is
		displayed, and you'll be prompted with "Edit Option:" </p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select PATIENT NAME: <b>SAMPLE,FRED A.</b>
NAME: SAMPLE,FRED A.// <b></b> <br>SEX: MALE// <b></b> <br>DATE OF BIRTH: AUG 22,1948// <b></b> <br>HISTORY: <br>  1&gt;Owing to poverty in early youth, patient seems not to<br>  2&gt;have had proper diet. Since achieving economic success,<br>  3&gt;his diet has been adequate, but traces of original<br>  4&gt;deficiency remain.<br> <br>EDIT OPTION:<br></pre> <hr> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> For a guide to using the Line Editor, please refer to the
		<a href="le_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Line Editor" class="bodylink">Line
		Editor</a> chapter in this manual.</p> <hr> 
	 <h4><a name="computed">COMPUTED Fields</a></h4> 
	 <p>COMPUTED-type fields are typically used to output a value computed at
		run-time in a report. You can't edit the value of a COMPUTED field. </p> 
	 <p>An example of a COMPUTED field would be a field that calculated AGE
		based on today's date and a patient's DATE OF BIRTH field. Because the field is
		a COMPUTED DATA TYPE, it can output a patient's current age based on whatever
		today's date is. You can't <i>edit</i> the AGE field, but you can use it to
		print out the current age of the patient.</p> 
	 <p>You're most likely to come across COMPUTED fields when printing with the
		CAPTIONED PRINT template. Choosing the
		<a href="pr_intro.htm#captioned" title="CAPTIONED" class="bodylink">CAPTIONED</a> OUTPUT template automatically outputs all normal
		fields containing data for each entry in a report. However, you must choose
		whether you want COMPUTED fields included in the output as well: </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p align="center"><img src="he_4.gif" alt="Example of Being Prompted to Choose COMPUTED Fields in Output." height="97" width="619"> </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> For more information on CAPTIONED output, please refer to
		the "<a href="in_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Inquire" class="bodylink">Inquire</a>" and "<a href="pr_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Print" class="bodylink">Print</a>" chapters in this manual.</p> <hr> 
	 <h4><a name="pointer">POINTER TO A FILE Fields</a></h4> 
	 <p>A POINTER TO A FILE-type field is a field that directs the computer to
		another file for information. If you're working in the PATIENT file, for
		example, and you've reached a field that asks for the patient's STATE, the
		field is probably a POINTER TO A FILE field that "points" to the STATE file.
		Because of pointers, such commonly used information as states can be stored in
		a single STATE file. Then, every file (PATIENT, VENDOR, INSURANCE, etc.) that
		needs to record a value for STATE can use a POINTER TO A FILE field to the
		STATE file to store that information. </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p align="center"><img src="he_2.gif" alt="Example Showing Pointer Relationships Between Fileds and Files" height="511" width="625"> </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p>If the choice you need is not listed, you can add that choice by typing
		it in (provided you have LAYGO access to add the entry). If the entry you enter
		is not matched, you're asked if you want to add a new entry. If you answer YES,
		VA FileMan adds the new entry. For example, if there was a state that did not
		have an entry in the STATE file, you could add it by entering it at the
		"STATE:" field prompt. </p> <hr> 
	 <h4><a name="variable">VARIABLE-POINTER Fields</a></h4> 
	 <p>A VARIABLE-POINTER-type field is like the regular
		<a href="#pointer" title="POINTER TO A FILE" class="bodylink">POINTER TO A
		FILE</a> field type, with one difference: the VARIABLE-POINTER DATA TYPE can
		point to a single record in one of <i>several</i> files, whereas the regular
		POINTER TO A FILE DATA TYPE can point to a single record in only <i>one</i>
		file. The PATIENT file, for example, might use a VARIABLE-POINTER to identify a
		Provider; the Provider might be a Staff Provider, stored in the PROVIDER file,
		or an Outside Provider, stored in another file.</p> 
	 <p>Let's say you're working in a PATIENT file entry, and you need
		information that explains how to look up a name listed in one of several files.
		To get Help, simply enter a single question mark ("<b>?</b>") at the "PROVIDER"
		prompt. Now, on your screen, you'll see instructions that explain how to choose
		a Provider from either of the two files being pointed to: </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p align="center"><img src="he_3.gif" alt="Example Showing the Pointer Prefixes." height="175" width="577"> </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p>With VARIABLE-POINTER fields, you need to use a PREFIX in addition to an
		entry name to select an entry. In this example, the online Help tells you that
		to select a Staff Provider, prefix the Provider's name with "<b>S.</b>". To
		select an Outside Provider, prefix the Provider's name with "<b>O.</b>". </p> 
	 <p>You can enter a PREFIX and a question mark to get a list of entries in a
		particular pointed-to file. For example, if you enter "<b>S.?</b>" you can get
		a list of all Staff Providers. Likewise you can enter "<b>S.SMITH</b>" to get a
		list of all Staff Providers whose last names are SMITH. You can also enter
		"<b>S.SMITH,JOSEPH</b>" to select a Staff Provider named Joseph Smith.</p> 
	 <p>For example:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>PROVIDER: <b>S.?</b>
     CHOOSE FROM: 
       ALLEN,JAKE 
       ANDREWS,JOHN
        :
</pre> <hr> 
	 <p>You can also select an entry in a VARIABLE-POINTER field by just
		entering a name <i>without</i> the PREFIX. In this case, VA FileMan searches
		each pointed-to file in succession until a match is found. </p> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> This method requires more processing time, since VA FileMan
		will need to search the various pointed-to files. </p> 
	 <p>For example, to choose a Provider without specifying in which file the
		Provider can be found, enter the Provider name only:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>PROVIDER: <b>MCCOY,LEONARD M</b>

    Searching for a Staff Provider

    Searching for a Outside Provider  MCCOY,LEONARD M 
            ...OK?  YES// <b></b>  (YES)<br></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>You can add an entry to one of the files that is being pointed to by a
		VARIABLE-POINTER field. To do this, enter the appropriate PREFIX and the new
		name to add at the field prompt. </p> 
	 <p>For example, to add "MCCOY,LEONARD M" as an Outside Provider (not a
		Staff Provider), use the appropriate PREFIX when adding the new entry (in this
		case, "<b>O.</b>"). When the requested name is not found, you're asked if you
		want to add the Provider as a new entry. To add the entry, enter YES: </p>

	 <h4><span class="badge">22.2</span><a name="label">LABEL REFERENCE fields</a></h4> 
	 <p>A
field defined as a LABEL REFERENCE data type is designed to store a tag
and routine entry of the format, TAG^ROUTINE. It is stored as a
free-text field.</p>
   <pre>LABEL REFERENCE: <strong>TEST^BOO</strong></pre>
   <hr> 

	 <h4><span class="badge">22.2</span><a name="time">TIME fields</a></h4> 
	 <p>A field defined as a TIME data type can accept many of the date/time entries, but only stores the TIME portion.</p>
   <pre>TIME: <strong>?</strong>
Enter 'NOW' or some valid time like '2:33PM'
              Time may include seconds.
TIME: <strong>15:09:43</strong> (15:09:43)</pre>
   <hr>

	 <h4><span class="badge">22.2</span><a name="year">YEAR fields</a></h4> 
	 <p>A field defined as a YEAR data type can accept many of the date entries, but only stores the YEAR portion.</p>
   <pre>YEAR: <strong>?</strong>

     Enter a 4-digit year, e.g., '2015'.
     Must not be earlier than 1980
Examples of Valid Dates:
   JAN 20 1957 or 20 JAN 57 or 1/20/57 or 012057  (omitting punctuation)
   T   (for TODAY),  T+1 (for TOMORROW),  T+2,  T+7, etc.
   T-1 (for YESTERDAY),  T-3W (for 3 WEEKS AGO), etc.
If the year is omitted, the computer uses CURRENT YEAR.
A 2-digit year means no more than 20 years in the future, or 80 years in
the past.
You may omit the precise day of the month, e.g.: Jan, 1957
YEAR: <strong>2014</strong></pre>

	 <h4><span class="badge">22.2</span><a name="utc">UNIVERSAL TIME Fields</a></h4> 
   <p>A
field defined as a UNIVERSAL TIME data type can accept many of the
date/time entries and stores the date/time in a format with the local
time and includes an indicator showing the offset from Universal Time.</p>
   <p>The
first 14 characters of the internal storage of the UNIVERSAL TIME data
type are exactly like the current DATE/TIME data type that includes
seconds. The three characters in position 15, 16, and 17 indicate the
UTC time offset in five (5) minute increments. In the example below:
(440-500)/12=-5, this is a negative five hour offset from UTC.</p>
   <pre>External: JAN 6,2016@08:03:36 (UTC-5:00)             Internal: 3160106.080336440</pre>

	 <h4><span class="badge">22.2</span><a name="ftpointer">FT POINTER Fields</a></h4> 
	 <p>A
field defined as a FT POINTER data type works similar to the POINTER
data type, but internally stores the free text that was returned from
the pointed-to value. The example below shows selecting the first entry
from File 200 (NEW PERSON).</p>
   <pre>FREE TEXT POINTER: <strong>`1</strong>  USER,ONE     DBA</pre>
   <hr> 

	 <h4><span class="badge">22.2</span><a name="ftdate">FT DATE Fields</a></h4> 
	 <p>A
field defined as a FT DATE data type works similar to the DATE/TIME
data type, but internally stores the free text that was input by the
user to determine the date. So, for example, typing T-1 to store
yesterday's date will not actually store yesterday's date, but "T-1",
implying a relative date.</p>
   <pre>FREE TEXT DATE: <strong>?</strong>

Examples of Valid Dates:
  JAN 20 1957 or 20 JAN 57 or 1/20/57 or 012057
  T   (for TODAY),  T+1 (for TOMORROW),  T+2,  T+7,  etc.
  T-1 (for YESTERDAY),  T-3W (for 3 WEEKS AGO), etc.
If the year is omitted, the computer uses CURRENT YEAR.  Two digit year
  assumes no more than 20 years in the future, or 80 years in the past.

	 <h4><span class="badge">22.2</span><a name="ratio">RATIO Fields</a></h4> 
	 <p>A
field defined as a RATIO data type is designed to accept two numbers
with a colon â&#8364;&#339;:â&#8364;&#157; between the two numbers. It is formatted and
stored like a mathematical ratio.</p>
   <pre>RATIO: <strong>1:3</strong></pre>

	 <h4><a name="subfiles">Subfiles (Multiples)</a></h4> 
	 <p>Sometimes, a single field in a record is not enough to hold all the
		information required. For example, to keep track of the appointment history for
		a patient, a single field would not be enough. An ordinary field could only
		hold enough information to record a single appointment. But there needs to be a
		way to record as many appointments as a patient has had, which could range from
		none to several hundred. In addition, each appointment might have its own
		information that needs to be stored, such as date, time, location, doctor, etc.
		</p> 
	 <p>This situation is handled with what are known as Subfiles (also known as
		Multiples). Within an individual record, a Subfile (Multiple) can be used to
		hold this type of information.</p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p align="center"><img src="he_5.gif" alt="Example of a Multiple Record." height="269" width="500"> </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p>The fields in a Subfile (in this example, DATE, TIME, LOCATION, and
		DOCTOR) are called <i>Subfields</i>. </p> 
	 <p>The word "Select" is always the first part of the prompt when you
		encounter a Multiple, to indicate that you are choosing among one of several
		possible values on file:</p> 
	 <pre>    Select APPOINTMENTS:</pre> 
	 <p>If, for a given Multiple, more than one entry has already been entered,
		the most recently created entry is displayed as a default. To see the list of
		entries already in the Mmultiple, enter two question marks ("<b>?? </b>") at
		the "Select..." prompt.</p> 
	 <p>Because they are so useful, Subfiles (Multiples) are widely used
		throughout
		<acronym title="Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture/Decentralized Hospital Computer Program">VistA</acronym>.
		They are usually straightforward to use, because their structure as Subfiles
		mirrors the real-world structure of the information. For example, for a
		purchase order, the top-level record would be the purchase order. Because a
		single purchase order needs a place to store as few or as many items as are
		requested, the purchase order record has a Multiple to record the order items
		for the purchase order. </p> 
	 <p>Subfiles can themselves contain Subfiles creating additional levels in
		files.</p>
