	 <H5><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H5> 
	 <P>With the
		<A HREF="in_intro.htm#Option" TITLE="Inquire to File Entries"
		 CLASS="bodylink">Inquire to File Entries</A> option, you can select entries
		from a file, one by one, choose a format for displaying the selected entries,
		and then output the selected entries. </P> 
	 <P>VA FileMan's print capabilities, on the other hand, allow you to select
		entries, not one by one, but instead by choosing a range of entries based on
		the sorting order. You can choose all entries in a file, for example, and sort
		them in alphabetical order for the printout. Alternatively, you can choose all
		entries sorting between "E" and "F" and sort them in alphabetical order for the
		printout. </P> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="print_capabilities">VA FileMan's Print Capabilities</A></H5> 
	 <P>There are two ways in which you'll have an opportunity to use VA
		FileMan's print capabilities: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>An option that has been set up already to allow you to print from a
		  particular file.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>VA FileMan's Print File Entries option, which lets you print from any
		  file to which you have access. </LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>In either case, use of VA FileMan's print features is very similar. In
		most cases, the only difference is that with the Print File Entries option, you
		have to choose from which file to print. </P> 
	 <P>Unlike the
		<A HREF="in_intro.htm#Option" TITLE="Inquire to File Entries"
		 CLASS="bodylink">Inquire to File Entries</A> option, which displays individual
		records, VA FileMan's print can list all records in a file. Thus, the focus of
		the Inquire to File Entries option is a single or small group of entries while
		VA FileMan's prints are concerned with the entire file. </P> 
	 <P>VA FileMan's print features allow considerable flexibility in selecting
		entries, ordering (or sorting) the entries selected, choosing which fields to
		display, and formatting the output. </P> 
	 <P>The following two basic components can be used to create a report: </P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>"<B><A HREF="#specifying_sort" TITLE="Specifying SORT BY Fields"
		  CLASS="bodylink">SORT BY:</A></B>" dialogue. Used to sort (and sometimes narrow

		<LI>"<B><A HREF="#specifying_print"
		  TITLE="Specifying PRINT Fields" CLASS="bodylink">PRINT FIELD:</A></B>"
		  dialogue. Used to choose the fields you want and the format of their display.
		  </LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P>The choices you can make at these two prompts are discussed in detail
		later in the chapter. </P> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="standard">Standard Column Format for VA FileMan
		Prints</A></H5> 
	 <P>VA FileMan has a standard, columnar format for print output. The file
		name, current date/time, and page number appear at the top of each report page,
		followed by column headings that correspond to the labels of selected fields.
		There are many ways to customize the format, as shown below:</P> 
	 <PRE></PRE> <HR> 
	 <PRE>PATIENT LIST                          NOV 28, 1996     11:32   PAGE 1

    CAPLAN,IRVING           MALE 
    DOE,JANE                FEMALE</PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>This simple example of a report is generated by the dialogue that
		follows. It prints information from all the entries in the PATIENT file,
		ordered by NAME (the .01 field in the file). Only data from the NAME and SEX
		fields are printed, as requested at the "PRINT FIELD:" prompts: </P>

	 <P></P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> You would have received information about every patient in
		the file, not just these four. You could have asked for several more fields to
		be printed. They would appear as columns of output, left to right, in the order
		specified. </P> <HR> 
	 <H4><A NAME="specifying_sort">Sorting</A></H4> 
	 <H5>Specifying SORT BY Fields</H5> 
	 <P>Sorting determines the <I>order</I> that records are printed in your
		reports. You can accept the default order (by the .01 field), or you can
		specify your own sorting order. The sort can be a simple sort, based on only
		one field, or you can sort based on the values of several fields. </P> 
	 <P>For example, if you want to print the entries in order from oldest to
		youngest patient, you could sort the report by date of birth (the DATE OF BIRTH
		field in the PATIENT file): </P> 
	 <P></P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="pr_2.gif" WIDTH="557" HEIGHT="200"
		ALT="Example of Entering Sort Fields."> </P> 
	 <P></P> 
	 <P>The output then prints in the following order (by DATE OF BIRTH): </P> 
	 <P></P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="pr_3.gif" WIDTH="601" HEIGHT="148"
		ALT="Example of a Printed Report."> </P> 
	 <P></P> 
	 <P>In the previous example, the sort criterion (DATE OF BIRTH) is printed
		with every change in sort value. VA FileMan does this when a sort field is not
		specified as a print field. </P> 
	 <P>To suppress the printing of sort values (subheaders) in the body of your
		report, you can either: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Add the field you are sorting by to the print field
		  list.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Place an at-sign ("<B>@</B>") in front of the field label at the
		  "SORT BY:" prompt. In the previous example, you would sort by <B>@DATE OF
		  BIRTH</B> instead of <B>DATE OF BIRTH</B>. </LI> 
	 </UL> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="order">Sorting Order</A></H5> 
	 <P>The ordering of entries within a sort is generally from low value to
		high value. Some special cases: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><A HREF="he_intro.htm#set" TITLE="SET OF CODES" CLASS="bodylink">SET
		  OF CODES</A> DATA TYPEs are sorted by the internally stored code, not the value
		  which is output.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><A HREF="he_intro.htm#free" TITLE="FREE TEXT" CLASS="bodylink">FREE
		  TEXT</A> fields usually sort from lowest value to highest value following the
		  ASCII sorting sequence: Digits sort before uppercase letters, which sort before
		  lowercase letters (e.g., <B>M1</B> sorts before <B>MC</B> which sorts before
		  <B>Mc</B>). </LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P><B>Sorting Canonic Numbers and Non-Canonic Strings, and the ;TXT Sort
		Qualifier</B></P> 
	 <P>Canonic numbers are pure numbers that do not have leading zeros, or
		trailing zeros after a decimal point. Thus, <B>1.1</B> is a canonic number but
		<B>01.1</B> and <B>1.10</B> are not. A non-canonic string is everything else.
		For example, <B>"8C"</B> is a non-canonic string. </P> 
	 <P>This distinction is important when sorting, because in all VA FileMan
		sorting, canonic numbers sort first, and everything else sorts second. Usually
		this works very well. But in a few cases where sort fields contain a mix of
		canonic numbers and non-canonic strings, unexpected sort orders result. Classic
		cases include sorting on Social Security Numbers and on ward locations. </P> 
	 <P>Consider Social Security Numbers (SSNs). The SSNs <B>333333333</B> and
		<B>999999900</B> are canonic numbers. But the SSN <B>098769000</B> is
		<I>not</I> a canonic number, because of its leading zero. When you use the
		default sort based on Social Security Number, you get output that looks like
		the following: </P> 
	 <P></P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="pr_4.gif" WIDTH="558" HEIGHT="143"
		ALT="Example Showing Canonic Vs. Non-Canonic Numbers."> </P> 
	 <P></P> 
	 <P>A similar situation occurs when you sort on ward locations. Suppose you
		have wards <B>8</B>, <B>8C</B>, and <B>9</B>. <B>8</B> and <B>9</B> are canonic
		numbers, while <B>8C</B> is a non-canonic string. Thus, if you sort on ward
		location, your output comes out in this order: <B>8</B>, <B>9</B>, <B>8C</B>.
		</P> 
	 <P>To avoid this problem, use the sort qualifier "<B>;TXT</B>" on your sort
		field. This forces all field values to be <I>non</I>-canonic, with the result
		that a group of strings like <B>8</B>, <B>8C</B>, and <B>9</B> sort in the
		expected order.</P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> For more information on the "<B>;TXT</B>" sort qualifier,
		please refer to the list of
		<A HREF="#sort_reference" TITLE="Sort Qualifiers" CLASS="bodylink">Sort
		Qualifiers</A> below. </P> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="select">Sorting to Select Entries for Printing</A></H5> 
	 <P>Besides using sorting to determine the <I>order</I> of entries printed,
		you can also use the "START WITH ...:" prompt to restrict what entries are
		printed to a range. For example, if you accept the default sort range (from
		first to last), you may get a report with every item in the file listed. You
		can cut this list down to a subset of the entries in the file by how you sort
		(e.g., entries that sort from JONES,A to SMITH,Z only). </P> 
	 <P>To specify a sort range, enter the range starting point at the "START
		WITH...:" prompt, and the range end point at the "GO TO...:" prompt. For
		example: </P> 
	 <PRE></PRE> <HR> 
	 <PRE>SORT BY: NAME// <B>&lt;RET&gt;</B>
      START WITH NAME: FIRST// <B>JONES,A</B>
      GO TO NAME:  LAST// <B>SMITH,Z</B></PRE> <HR> 
	 <P><B>Selecting All Entries with the Same Value for One Field</B></P> 
	 <P>A simple kind of selecting can be done to choose only those entries that
		have a particular value for a field. For example, to list only those patients
		who have a DIAGNOSIS equal to CANCER, you can sort as in the example below:
		</P> 
	 <PRE>    START WITH DIAGNOSIS: FIRST// <B>CANCER</B>
    GO TO DIAGNOSIS: LAST// <B>CANCER</B> </PRE> 
	 <P><B>Other Ways of Selecting Entries</B></P> 
	 <P>The "START WITH ... GO TO .." dialogue can be used to do sophisticated
		selecting from a file. Computed expressions can be entered at the prompts to
		filter the entries to be printed. </P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> These powerful techniques are discussed in the "<A
		HREF="../u2/ce_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" TITLE="Computed Expressions"
		CLASS="bodylink">Computed Expressions</A>" chapter of the "VA FileMan Advanced
		User Manual." </P> 
	 <P>You can also use VA FileMan's search functions to select entries for
		printing. </P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> For more information on the VA FileMan's search functions,
		please refer to the "<A HREF="sr_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" TITLE="Search"
		CLASS="bodylink">Search</A>" chapter in this manual.</P> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="null">Including Entries with Null Fields in Your Sort (Start
		With @)</A></H5> 
	 <P>When you sort a report on a particular field, if any record in the file
		has <I>no value</I> in that field, that record will be <I>skipped</I> and
		<I>not printed</I>, if you accept the default sort start value (FIRST). In
		other words, in a print from the PATIENT file, if you sort on the PROVIDER
		field, start sorting from the default of FIRST, and there are some patients
		with nothing in their PROVIDER field, those patients will be <I>left off of the
		report entirely</I>.</P> 
	 <P>If you want to include records in your report, even if they have no
		value in the field you are sorting on, sort from "<B>@</B>" instead of
		accepting the default of FIRST. As in the example below, enter an at-sign
		("<B>@</B>") at the "START WITH:" prompt: </P>

	 <H5>Specifying Fields to Print</H5> 
	 <P>After you have specified the order in which the output should occur, you
		are asked to list the fields you want displayed for each file entry. In the
		simplest case, fields are identified by their label. If you enter a single
		question mark ("<B>?</B>") at the prompt, a list of all the fields in the file
		is displayed. If you enter the name of a multiple, you are asked for the
		subfields you want printed. A subfield must be specified even if the multiple
		has only one subfield. </P> 
	 <P>To print all fields in the file, enter <B>ALL</B> (uppercase) at the
		"FIRST PRINT FIELD:" prompt. You are then prompted:</P> 
	 <PRE>    Do you mean ALL the fields in the file? NO//</PRE> 
	 <P>Enter YES to indicate all fields. Otherwise, the file is searched for
		field labels beginning with the letters "ALL". </P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> Fields from other files can also be printed using extended
		pointers. This technique is described in the "<A HREF="../u2/ce_cf.htm"
		TITLE="Using Computed Expressions in COMPUTED Fields" CLASS="bodylink">Using
		Computed Expressions in COMPUTED Fields</A>" topic in the "<A
		HREF="../u2/ce_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" TITLE="Computed Expressions"
		CLASS="bodylink">Computed Expressions</A>" chapter of the <I>VA FileMan
		Advanced User Manual</I>. You can also enter other computed expressions, which
		are also described in that chapter.</P> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="print_qualifiers">Print Qualifier Reference</A></H5> 
	 <P>VA FileMan's print capabilities provide many ways to format a report. If
		you don't specify any formatting controls, a format is constructed
		automatically. The width of each field's print area is computed using
		information from the field's definition. The default width is the larger of the
		maximum number of characters allowed for the field and the length of the
		longest word of the field's label (or other specification) in the print
		dialogue. Two inter-column spaces are added to separate fields. </P> 
	 <P>However, by using print qualifiers at the "PRINT FIELD:" prompt, for
		each field, you can indicate how long the field's print area should be, where
		it should start, how many lines to skip before printing the field, and the
		column title for the field. You can also insert literal strings within the
		output. </P> 
	 <P>For fields that have numeric values, you can call for several arithmetic
		calculations and indicate the number of decimal digits of accuracy. If you have
		requested subtotals in the sort dialogue (by preceding the field with a
		"<B>+</B>"), calculations are done at the subtotal level as well. </P>

		notify you, if you try to create a template with a template name that already
		exists for a file. PRINT templates are stored in the PRINT TEMPLATE file
		(#.4).</P> 
	 <P>To see a list of all existing templates that pertain to the file you are
		dealing with, enter a left bracket and a question mark ("<B>[?</B>") at the
		prompt where you can retrieve templates. For example: </P> 
	 <PRE>    FIRST PRINT FIELD: <B>[?</B></PRE> 
	 <P>This gives you a list of the PRINT templates available for your use with

		hold your heading format. Suppose, for example, that you want the patient's
		name and date of birth to appear as the heading at every page break. You could
		first create a PATIENT HEADER template as follows: </P> 
	 <PRE></PRE> <HR> 
	 <PRE>SORT BY: <B>NAME</B>
    START WITH NAME:  FIRST// <B>&lt;RET&gt;</B>
    FIRST PRINT FIELD: <B>&quot;PATIENT NAME:  &quot;</B> 
    THEN PRINT FIELD: <B>NAME</B>  
    THEN PRINT FIELD: <B>&quot;DATE OF BIRTH:  &quot;;C50</B>
    THEN PRINT FIELD: <B>DATE OF BIRTH</B>
    THEN PRINT FIELD: <B>&lt;RET&gt;</B>
      *************************
    Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// <B>&lt;RET&gt;</B>
    STORE PRINT LOGIC IN TEMPLATE: <B>PATIENT HEADER</B>
      Are you adding 'PATIENT HEADER' as a new PRINT TEMPLATE?  No// <B>YES &lt;RET&gt;</B>  (Yes)  
    DEVICE:</PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>Then, at a later time, when you do another print, at the heading prompt,
		enter the template name: </P> 
	 <PRE>    Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// <B>[PATIENT HEADER]</B></PRE> 
	 <P>When you enter a PRINT template name such as PATIENT HEADER at the
		"Heading (S/C):..." prompt, the format of the template is used as a replacement
		for the full normal report heading on each page of your report (it replaces the
		full default heading, including title, time, date, page number, field names,
		and separator line). Thus, the header, as defined above, would contain
		<I>no</I> column headings and would <I>not</I> be separated from the body of
		the report by a horizontal line or even a blank line. You can add these in
		yourself as print fields in the template, if you so desire. </P> 
	 <P><B>Custom Footers</B></P> 
	 <P>You can also add footers to the bottom of each page of a report. First,
		save the contents of the footer in a template as you do to create a custom
		heading. Then, use the template at the "HEADING:" prompt with a dash
		("<B>-</B>") before the first bracket: </P> 
	 <PRE>Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// <B>-[PATIENT FOOTER]</B></PRE> 
	 <P>You can specify both a heading and a footer like this: </P> 
	 <PRE>    Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// <B>[PATIENT HEADER]-[PATIENT FOOTER]</B> </PRE> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> Specifying only a footer at the "Heading (S/C):" prompt
		suppresses the default heading. If you need a header as well as footer, you
		must use custom templates for both. </P><HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="criteria">Printing Sort Criteria in the Heading or the
		Footer</A></H5> 
	 <P>You can print the sort criteria (values used to sort the report) in the
		header in two different ways:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>At the "Heading (S/C):" prompt, entering "<B>C</B>" prints the sort
		  criteria in the automatically generated report heading.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Use the
		  <A HREF="#sort_reference" TITLE="Sort Qualifiers" CLASS="bodylink">sort
		  qualifier</A> <B>;Pa-b</B> to save the FROM and TO values used to sort a
		  report. Then, in a customized header or footer (stored in SORT templates), you
		  can retrieve the sort values with PARAM("a-string"). <BR> <BR> <B>NOTE:</B> For
		  more information, please refer to the description of the <A HREF="#pa-b"
		  TITLE="Sort Qualifier ;Pa-b" CLASS="bodylink"><B>;Pa-b</B></A> sort
		  qualifier.</LI>
