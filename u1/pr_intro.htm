<h4><big><big>Print: How to Print Reports from Files</big></big></h4>
<h5><big><big><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></big></big></h5>
<p>With the <a href="in_intro.htm#Option" title="Inquire to File Entries" class="bodylink">Inquire
to File Entries</a> option, you can select entries from a file,
one by one, choose a format for displaying the selected entries, and
then output the selected entries. </p>
<p>VA FileMan's print capabilities, on the other hand, allow you
to select entries, not one by one, but instead by choosing a range of
entries based on the sorting order. You can choose all entries in a
file, for example, and sort them in alphabetical order for the
printout. Alternatively, you can choose all entries sorting between "E"
and "F" and sort them in alphabetical order for the printout. </p>
<hr>
<h5><big><big><a name="print_capabilities">VA FileMan's Print
Capabilities</a></big></big></h5>
<p>There are two ways in which you'll have an opportunity to use
VA FileMan's print capabilities: </p>
<ul>
<li>An option that has been set up already to allow you to
print from a particular file.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>VA FileMan's Print File Entries option, which lets you
print from any file to which you have access. </li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, use of VA FileMan's print features is very
similar. In most cases, the only difference is that with the Print File
Entries option, you have to choose from which file to print. </p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="in_intro.htm#Option" title="Inquire to File Entries" class="bodylink">Inquire
to File Entries</a> option, which displays individual records, VA
FileMan's print can list all records in a file. Thus, the focus of the
Inquire to File Entries option is a single or small group of entries
while VA FileMan's prints are concerned with the entire file. </p>
<p>VA FileMan's print features allow considerable flexibility in
selecting entries, ordering (or sorting) the entries selected, choosing
which fields to display, and formatting the output. </p>
<p>The following two basic components can be used to create a
report: </p>
<ol>
<li>"<b><a href="#specifying_sort" title="Specifying SORT BY Fields" class="bodylink">SORT
BY:</a></b>" dialogue. Used to sort (and sometimes narrow
down) the entries that you want displayed.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>"<b><a href="#specifying_print" title="Specifying PRINT Fields" class="bodylink">PRINT
FIELD:</a></b>" dialogue. Used to choose the fields you
want and the format of their display. </li>
</ol>
<p>The choices you can make at these two prompts are discussed in
detail later in the chapter. </p>
<hr>
<h5><big><big><a name="standard">Standard Column Format for VA
FileMan Prints</a></big></big></h5>
<p>VA FileMan has a standard, columnar format for print output.
The file name, current date/time, and page number appear at the top of
each report page, followed by column headings that correspond to the
labels of selected fields. There are many ways to customize the format,
as shown below:</p>
<pre></pre>
<hr>
<pre>PATIENT LIST NOV 28, 1996 11:32 PAGE 1<br> NAME SEX<br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br> ADAMS,JOHN MALE <br> BROWN,JOE MALE <br> CAPLAN,IRVING MALE <br> DOE,JANE FEMALE</pre>
<hr>
<p>This simple example of a report is generated by the dialogue
that follows. It prints information from all the entries in the PATIENT
file, ordered by NAME (the .01 field in the file). Only data from the
NAME and SEX fields are printed, as requested at the "PRINT FIELD:"
prompts: </p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><img src="pr_1.gif" alt="Example of Entering Print Fields." height="180" width="598"> </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> You would have received information
about every patient in the file, not just these four. You could have
asked for several more fields to be printed. They would appear as
columns of output, left to right, in the order specified. </p>
<hr>
<h4><big><big><a name="specifying_sort">Sorting</a></big></big></h4>
<h5><big><big>Specifying SORT BY Fields</big></big></h5>
<p>Sorting determines the <i>order</i> that records
are printed in your reports. You can accept the default order (by the
.01 field), or you can specify your own sorting order. The sort can be
a simple sort, based on only one field, or you can sort based on the
values of several fields. </p>
<p>For example, if you want to print the entries in order from
oldest to youngest patient, you could sort the report by date of birth
(the DATE OF BIRTH field in the PATIENT file): </p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><img src="pr_2.gif" alt="Example of Entering Sort Fields." height="200" width="557"> </p>
<p></p>
<p>The output then prints in the following order (by DATE OF
BIRTH): </p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><img src="pr_3.gif" alt="Example of a Printed Report." height="148" width="601"> </p>
<p></p>
<p>In the previous example, the sort criterion (DATE OF BIRTH) is
printed with every change in sort value. VA FileMan does this when a
sort field is not specified as a print field. </p>
<p>To suppress the printing of sort values (subheaders) in the
body of your report, you can either: </p>
<ul>
<li>Add the field you are sorting by to the print field list.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Place an at-sign ("<b>@</b>") in front of the
field label at the "SORT BY:" prompt. In the previous example, you
would sort by <b>@DATE OF BIRTH</b> instead of <b>DATE
OF BIRTH</b>. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h5><big><big><a name="order">Sorting Order</a></big></big></h5>
<p>The ordering of entries within a sort is generally from low
value to high value. Some special cases: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="he_intro.htm#set" title="SET OF CODES" class="bodylink">SET OF CODES</a> DATA TYPEs are
sorted by the internally stored code, not the value which is output.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><a href="he_intro.htm#free" title="FREE TEXT" class="bodylink">FREE TEXT</a> fields usually sort
from lowest value to highest value following the ASCII sorting
sequence: Digits sort before uppercase letters, which sort before
lowercase letters (e.g., <b>M1</b> sorts before <b>MC</b>
which sorts before <b>Mc</b>). </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Sorting Canonic Numbers and Non-Canonic Strings, and
the ;TXT Sort Qualifier</b></p>
<p>Canonic numbers are pure numbers that do not have leading
zeros, or trailing zeros after a decimal point. Thus, <b>1.1</b>
is a canonic number but <b>01.1</b> and <b>1.10</b>
are not. A non-canonic string is everything else. For example, <b>"8C"</b>
is a non-canonic string. </p>
<p>This distinction is important when sorting, because in all VA
FileMan sorting, canonic numbers sort first, and everything else sorts
second. Usually this works very well. But in a few cases where sort
fields contain a mix of canonic numbers and non-canonic strings,
unexpected sort orders result. Classic cases include sorting on Social
Security Numbers and on ward locations. </p>
<p>Consider Social Security Numbers (SSNs). The SSNs <b>333333333</b>
and <b>999999900</b> are canonic numbers. But the SSN <b>098769000</b>
is <i>not</i> a canonic number, because of its leading
zero. When you use the default sort based on Social Security Number,
you get output that looks like the following: </p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><img src="pr_4.gif" alt="Example Showing Canonic Vs. Non-Canonic Numbers." height="143" width="558"> </p>
<p></p>
<p>A similar situation occurs when you sort on ward locations.
Suppose you have wards <b>8</b>, <b>8C</b>,
and <b>9</b>. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>
are canonic numbers, while <b>8C</b> is a non-canonic
string. Thus, if you sort on ward location, your output comes out in
this order: <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>8C</b>.
</p>
<p>To avoid this problem, use the sort qualifier "<b>;TXT</b>"
on your sort field. This forces all field values to be <i>non</i>-canonic,
with the result that a group of strings like <b>8</b>, <b>8C</b>,
and <b>9</b> sort in the expected order.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> For more information on the "<b>;TXT</b>"
sort qualifier, please refer to the list of <a href="#sort_reference" title="Sort Qualifiers" class="bodylink">Sort Qualifiers</a> below. </p>
<hr>
<h5><big><big><a name="select">Sorting to Select Entries for
Printing</a></big></big></h5>
<p>Besides using sorting to determine the <i>order</i>
of entries printed, you can also use the "START WITH ...:" prompt to
restrict what entries are printed to a range. For example, if you
accept the default sort range (from first to last), you may get a
report with every item in the file listed. You can cut this list down
to a subset of the entries in the file by how you sort (e.g., entries
that sort from JONES,A to SMITH,Z only). </p>
<p>To specify a sort range, enter the range starting point at the
"START WITH...:" prompt, and the range end point at the "GO TO...:"
prompt. For example: </p>
<pre></pre>
<hr>
<pre>SORT BY: NAME// <b></b><br>START WITH NAME: FIRST// <b>JONES,A</b><br>GO TO NAME: LAST// <b>SMITH,Z</b></pre>
<hr>
<p><b>Selecting All Entries with the Same Value for One
Field</b></p>
<p>A simple kind of selecting can be done to choose only those
entries that have a particular value for a field. For example, to list
only those patients who have a DIAGNOSIS equal to CANCER, you can sort
as in the example below: </p>
<pre> START WITH DIAGNOSIS: FIRST// <b>CANCER</b><br>GO TO DIAGNOSIS: LAST// <b>CANCER</b> </pre>
<p><big><b>Other Ways of Selecting Entries</b></big></p>
<p>The "START WITH ... GO TO .." dialogue can be used to do
sophisticated selecting from a file. Computed expressions can be
entered at the prompts to filter the entries to be printed. </p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> These powerful techniques are
discussed in the "<a href="../u2/ce_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Computed Expressions" class="bodylink">Computed
Expressions</a>" chapter of the "VA FileMan Advanced User
Manual." </p>
<p>You can also use VA FileMan's search functions to select
entries for printing. </p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> For more information on the VA
FileMan's search functions, please refer to the "<a href="sr_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Search" class="bodylink">Search</a>"
chapter in this manual.</p>
<hr>
<h5><big><big><a name="null">Including Entries with Null
Fields in Your Sort (Start With @)</a></big></big></h5>
<p>When you sort a report on a particular field, if any record in
the file has <i>no value</i> in that field, that record
will be <i>skipped</i> and <i>not printed</i>,
if you accept the default sort start value (FIRST). In other words, in
a print from the PATIENT file, if you sort on the PROVIDER field, start
sorting from the default of FIRST, and there are some patients with
nothing in their PROVIDER field, those patients will be <i>left
off of the report entirely</i>.</p>
<p>If you want to include records in your report, even if they
have no value in the field you are sorting on, sort from "<b>@</b>"
instead of accepting the default of FIRST. As in the example below,
enter an at-sign ("<b>@</b>") at the "START WITH:" prompt: </p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><img src="pr_5.gif" alt="Example of Creating a Report that Displays All Entries (with or without data)." height="244" width="570"> </p>
<p></p>
<p>The output of this sort would then include all records, even
those with no value in their PROVIDER fields: </p>

<hr>
<h5><big><big><a name="sort_reference">Sort Qualifier Reference</a></big></big></h5>
<p>As well as entering fields to sort by, you can also enter
formatting controls in the "SORT BY:" dialogue. Add these qualifiers to
the field label or to the computed expression you're entering at the
"SORT BY:" prompt. </p>
<p><b>Sort Qualifiers to use at "SORT BY:" Prompts</b></p>

the SORT BY field changes in addition to the grand totals at the end.
<p>You can sub-subtotal by adding a prefix of <b>+</b>
to two fields in the "SORT BY:" dialogue. For example:</p>
<pre> SORT BY: <b>+REGION</b><br>WITHIN REGION, SORT BY: <b>+STORE</b></pre>

<p>Only the first two letters of the name field will be
used for sorting: the order of "Maris,Roger" and "Mantle,Mickey", for
example, will be unpredictable in your output. </p>
</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">field;<b><a name="pa-b">Pa-b</a></b></td>
<td valign="top">Store sort range for display </td>
<td valign="top">The <b>;P</b> suffix
saves the "START WITH" and "GO TO" sort range for <i>one</i>
level of sort fields, for later reference at a "PRINT FIELD" prompt.
You can substitute any string (up to 60 characters in length) for "<b>a</b>"
and "<b>b</b>" in "<b>;Pa-b</b>". Whatever
strings you use as "<b>a</b>" and "<b>b</b>"
(e.g., FROM and TO) become subscripts of the PARAM() array:
<pre> SORT BY: <b>NAME;PFROM-TO</b><br>START WITH NAME: FIRST// <b>C</b><br>GO TO NAME: LAST// <b>Dzzzzz</b></pre>
<p>Then at a "PRINT FIELD" prompt, you can reference the
saved values by using PARAM("a-string") and PARAM("b-string"). Thus, in
this case: </p>
<pre> THEN PRINT FIELD: <b>PARAM("FROM")</b><br>THEN PRINT FIELD: <b>PARAM("TO")</b></pre>
<p>The sort-from and sort-to values of "C" and "Dzzzzz" in
the report would then print in the appropriate location. The typical
reason to save sort values, and then retrieve them from the PARAM array
in a print field, is for custom report headers (which are created as
PRINT templates). It is one method to print sort criteria in the report
header. </p>
<p>If you need to sort on <i>two or more</i>
fields, you need to use a different string for "<b>a</b>"
and "<b>b</b>" at each level, or else the values will
overwrite each other. </p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> No value is saved in the PARAM
array if the user accepts "FIRST" or "LAST" as the "START WITH" or "GO
TO" sort values; the PARAM array will be null. </p>

<td valign="top">The <b>;S</b> suffix
skips one line between sort field values, if no number is added. If you
specify a number ("<b>n</b>"), <b>n</b>-lines
are skipped. You can use this qualifier to skip lines after subtotals
are printed by inserting the following after the last subtotaled field:
<pre> WITHIN X, SORT BY: <b>@"";S</b><br>START WITH "": FIRST// <b>@</b><br>GO TO "": LAST// <b>@</b>
</pre>
</td>

<td valign="top">field<b>;"xxx"</b></td>
<td valign="top">Replace caption in subheader and
sort dialogue </td>
<td valign="top">The default subheader is the field
label or expression entered at the "SORT BY:" prompt. The same string
is used within the sort dialogue. You can substitute a string of your
choosing by adding a semicolon ("<b>;</b>") and text
enclosed in quotation marks. For example:
<pre> SORT BY: <b>DATE OF BIRTH;"Birthdate: "</b>
</pre>
<p>To suppress the caption in the subheader, enter two
double quotes after the semicolon: </p>
<pre> SORT BY: <b>DATE OF BIRTH;""</b></pre>
<p>The specified caption is also used in the subsequent
sort dialogue. This is useful in simplifying the sort dialogue when a
field label is confusing, is concatenated, or is an extended pointer.
For example: </p>
<pre> SORT BY: <b>STORE:REGION;"Location:"</b><br>START WITH Location: FIRST// <b></b><br>WITHIN Location, SORT BY: <b></b><br>PRINT FIELD: <b>STORE</b><br>THEN PRINT FIELD:</pre>

<h5><big><big><a name="sort_templates">Saving Sort Criteria
(SORT Templates)</a></big></big></h5>
<p>You can save your sort criteria in a SORT template. This lets
you reuse the same sorting instructions in future prints from the
current file. SORT templates are stored in the SORT TEMPLATE file
(#.401). If you sort by more than three fields, you are asked whether
you want to store your sort criteria in a SORT template: </p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><img src="pr_7.gif" alt="Example of Saving Sort Criteria." height="259" width="558"> </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Forcing Creation of a SORT Template</b></p>
<p>Ordinarily, you are only asked whether to save your sort
criteria in a SORT template if you enter three or more fields at the
"SORT BY:" prompts. However, to force this question to be asked, enter
a right bracket ("<b>]</b>") by itself at one "SORT BY:"
prompt. No matter how few fields you sort by, you'll still be prompted
to save your sort criteria in a SORT template.</p>
<pre> SORT BY: NAME// <b>]</b><br>SORT BY: NAME// </pre>
<p><b>Reusing Sort Criteria in New Reports</b></p>
<p>The reason to save sort criteria in a SORT template is so that
you can <i>reuse</i> your sort criteria in a new report
from the same file. </p>
<p>To reuse a SORT template as the sort criteria in a new report,
at the "SORT BY:" prompt in the new report, enter a left bracket ("<b>[</b>")
plus the template name: </p>
<pre></pre>
<hr>
<pre>OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: NEW PERSON<br> SORT BY: NAME// <b>[ADDRESS LIST </b><br> (Dec 08, 1995@07:53) User #34 File #200 <br> WANT TO EDIT 'ADDRESS LIST' TEMPLATE? NO// <br> FIRST PRINT FIELD: </pre>
<hr>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h4><big><big><a name="specifying_print">Choosing Print Fields</a></big></big></h4>
<h5><big><big>Specifying Fields to Print</big></big></h5>
<p>After you have specified the order in which the output should
occur, you are asked to list the fields you want displayed for each
file entry. In the simplest case, fields are identified by their label.
If you enter a single question mark ("<b>?</b>") at the
prompt, a list of all the fields in the file is displayed. If you enter
the name of a multiple, you are asked for the subfields you want
printed. A subfield must be specified even if the multiple has only one
subfield. </p>
<p>To print all fields in the file, enter <b>ALL</b>
(uppercase) at the "FIRST PRINT FIELD:" prompt. You are then prompted:</p>
<pre> Do you mean ALL the fields in the file? NO//</pre>
<p>Enter YES to indicate all fields. Otherwise, the file is
searched for field labels beginning with the letters "ALL". </p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Fields from other files can also be
printed using extended pointers. This technique is described in the "<a href="../u2/ce_cf.htm" title="Using Computed Expressions in COMPUTED Fields" class="bodylink">Using Computed Expressions in COMPUTED
Fields</a>" topic in the "<a href="../u2/ce_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Computed Expressions" class="bodylink">Computed Expressions</a>" chapter of
the <i>VA FileMan Advanced User Manual</i>. You can also
enter other computed expressions, which are also described in that
chapter.</p>
<hr>
<h5><big><big><a name="print_qualifiers">Print Qualifier
Reference</a></big></big></h5>
<p>VA FileMan's print capabilities provide many ways to format a
report. If you don't specify any formatting controls, a format is
constructed automatically. The width of each field's print area is
computed using information from the field's definition. The default
width is the larger of the maximum number of characters allowed for the
field and the length of the longest word of the field's label (or other
specification) in the print dialogue. Two inter-column spaces are added
to separate fields. </p>
<p>However, by using print qualifiers at the "PRINT FIELD:"
prompt, for each field, you can indicate how long the field's print
area should be, where it should start, how many lines to skip before
printing the field, and the column title for the field. You can also
insert literal strings within the output. </p>
<p>For fields that have numeric values, you can call for several
arithmetic calculations and indicate the number of decimal digits of
accuracy. If you have requested subtotals in the sort dialogue (by
preceding the field with a "<b>+</b>"), calculations are
done at the subtotal level as well. </p>

<h5><big><big><a name="print_templates">Saving Print Criteria
(PRINT Templates)</a></big></big></h5>
<p>PRINT templates let you store your print field specifications
for use at a later time. You can retrieve the template at a later time
by using the template name surrounded by square brackets. Template
names must be unique with respect to any other PRINT template created
for the same file. VA FileMan will notify you, if you try to create a
template with a template name that already exists for a file. PRINT
templates are stored in the PRINT TEMPLATE file (#.4).</p>
<p>To see a list of all existing templates that pertain to the
file you are dealing with, enter a left bracket and a question mark ("<b>[?</b>")
at the prompt where you can retrieve templates. For example: </p>
<pre> FIRST PRINT FIELD: <b>[?</b></pre>
<p>This gives you a list of the PRINT templates available for
your use with the file. </p>
<p>You are automatically prompted for a template name when it is
determined that a considerable amount of information has been
specified. If you choose five or more print fields, or if some of your
print fields have special formatting specifications, you are prompted
to store your print field specification in a PRINT template, as
follows: </p>
<pre> STORE PRINT LOGIC IN TEMPLATE: </pre>
<p>If you do not want to store your specifications in a template,
simply press the Enter/Return key. If you do want to save these print
specifications for future reuse, however, respond to this prompt with
the name of a template (either new or existing). Do <i>not</i>
enclose the name in brackets; use brackets only to invoke a template,
not to name one. </p>
<p><b>Forcing Creation of a PRINT Template</b></p>
<p>Ordinarily, you are only asked whether you want to save your
PRINT template if you enter five or more fields at the "PRINT FIELD:"
prompt, or enter complex print specifications. However, by entering a
right bracket ("<b>]</b>") by itself at one of your field
prompts, you can force the prompt that asks you for a template name, no
matter how few fields you specify. You must designate at least one
field to be printed to receive the template prompt, though. </p>
<p>For example: </p>
<pre></pre>
<hr>
<pre>PRINT FIELD: <b>]</b><br>PRINT FIELD: <b>NAME</b><br>THEN PRINT FIELD:<br>HEADING: <b></b><br> STORE PRINT LOGIC IN TEMPLATE: <b>ID PRINT</b></pre>
<hr>
<p><b>Using and Editing PRINT Templates</b></p>
<p>If a PRINT template has already been defined for a file, you
can answer the "FIRST PRINT FIELD:" prompt with the template name,
enclosed within brackets. For example: </p>
<pre></pre>
<hr>
<pre>FIRST PRINT FIELD: <b>[PATIENT DATA]</b><br>WANT TO EDIT 'PATIENT DATA' TEMPLATE? NO// <b>Y </b><br> NAME: PATIENT DATA// <br>READ ACCESS: <br>WRITE ACCESS: </pre>
<hr>
<p>After you retrieve a template that you yourself have created, you are asked if you want to
edit the template. If you answer YES (as shown above), you are allowed
to edit the template name. To delete the template, enter an at-sign ("<b>@</b>").
After the "NAME:" prompt, you can edit the template security codes for
READ ACCESS and WRITE ACCESS. </p>
<p>Next, you are prompted to edit each "PRINT FIELD:" value,
containing each print field stored in the template. You can leave each
print field as is, edit it, or delete it with the at-sign character ("<b>@</b>").
</p>
<p>To insert a new print field ahead of the print field being
displayed in your template, precede the print field you want to insert
with an up-arrow ("<b>^</b>"). See the following example of
adding to a PRINT template (INPUT and SORT templates have this feature
also): </p>
<pre></pre>
<hr>
<pre>FIRST PRINT FIELD: FIELD1//<br>THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD2// <br>THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD4// <b>^FIELD3</b><br>THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD4// </pre>
<hr>
<p>To insert a Multiple field and its subfields ahead of the
field currently displayed in the template, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter an up-arrow ("<b>^</b>") followed by the
name of the Multiple field.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Ignore the default presented at the "THEN PRINT FIELD:"
prompt and insert each subfield by entering an up-arrow ("<b>^</b>")
followed by the name of that subfield.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>After all subfields have been added, enter an up-arrow and
a right bracket ("<b>^]</b>").</li>
</ol>
<p>For example: </p>
<pre></pre>
<hr>
<pre>FIRST PRINT FIELD: FIELD1// <br>THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD2// <br>THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD3// <b>^MultField </b>(multiple)<br> THEN PRINT MultField SUB-FIELD: FIELD3// <b>^SubField1</b><br>THEN PRINT MultField SUB-FIELD: FIELD3// <b>^SubField2</b><br>THEN PRINT MultField SUB-FIELD: FIELD3// <b>^]</b><br>THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD3//<br></pre>

<p>Every file has a pre-defined CAPTIONED PRINT template that you
can select at the "PRINT FIELD:" prompt. The CAPTIONED PRINT Template
can be very useful; it prints out all non-empty fields for each entry in your
report. Use it is a quick way to get all the fields for each entry in
your report (much quicker than entering each field individually)! </p>
<p>Use it as follows: </p>
<pre> FIRST PRINT FIELD: <b>[CAPTIONED</b> </pre>
<p><b>COMPUTED Fields and Record Numbers in CAPTIONED OUTPUT</b></p>
<p>When you choose the CAPTIONED PRINT Template, you're prompted
with "Include COMPUTED fields". At this prompt, you can decide whether
to include COMPUTED-type fields in the output for each record, as well
as record numbers. </p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> For more information on COMPUTED

<h5><big><big><a name="multiple">Multiple Copies of a Print</a></big></big></h5>
<p>To generate more than one copy of a report, you must have an
output device on your system (such as a spool device or a sequential
disk processor [SDP]) which stores data in a linear format. If you
choose to send the output to such a device at the "DEVICE:" prompt, the
system prompts you as follows: </p>
<pre></pre>
<hr>
<pre>ENTER NUMBER OF COPIES: <b>4</b><br>OUTPUT COPIES TO DEVICE: <b>PRINTER</b></pre>
<hr>
<p>In this example, you are asking to print four copies to the
device called PRINTER. </p>
<p>You must be using VA FileMan with Kernel or with a device
handler similar to Kernel's to produce multiple copies. If you exceed
the maximum spool lines allowed you as defined in the KERNEL SYSTEM
PARAMETERS file (#8989.3), your report will be stopped. </p>
<hr>
<h5><big><big><a name="headings">Report Headings</a></big></big></h5>
<p>The heading in a report is what is printed at the top of each
report page. Ordinarily, there is a heading (report title), date of
report, time of report, page number, and column headers (field titles
for fields in the output), as shown below: </p>
<pre> PATIENT LIST JUL 19,1996 14:49 PAGE 1<br> SSN NAME<br> -------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>
<p>You can customize the report heading when you print. If you
ask for Help at the "Heading (S/C):..." prompt, VA FileMan displays the
following instructions: </p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><img src="pr_8.gif" alt="Example of Customizing Report Headings." height="378" width="558"> </p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus, at the "Heading (S/C):" prompt, you can: </p>
<ul>
<li>Enter "<b>S</b>" to not print the heading
(i.e., not print anything), if no records are found to print. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Enter "<b>C</b>" to print sort criteria in the
report heading on the first page.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Enter a new heading to replace the default heading or press
the Enter/Return key to accept the default heading. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h5><big><big><a name="suppressing">Suppressing Report
Headings (and Page Feeds)</a></big></big></h5>
<p>If you do not want headings to be printed in your output,
enter an at-sign ("<b>@</b>") at the "HEADING:" prompt: </p>
<pre> HEADING: PATIENT LIST// <b>@</b></pre>
<p>If you want neither headings nor page feeds in your output,
enter two at-signs ("<b>@@</b>") at the "HEADING:" prompt. </p>
<p>If you suppress the headings in your output and also save your
print criteria in a PRINT template, you will be asked: </p>
<pre> DO YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SUPPRESS SUBHEADERS WHEN PRINTING TEMPLATE? </pre>
<p>Subheaders are the names of SORT BY fields you see in the body
of your report, when you don't include those SORT BY fields as print
fields. To automatically suppress all subheaders, answer YES at this
prompt. </p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> When you are sorting, you can
suppress subheaders individually at each sort level by entering an
at-sign ("<b>@</b>") in front of the field on which you are
sorting. For more information, please refer to the "<a href="#specifying_sort" title="Sorting" class="bodylink">Sorting</a>"
topic.</p>
<hr>
<h5><big><big><a name="custom">Custom Headings and Footers</a></big></big></h5>
<p>You can print complex, multi-line headings by using a PRINT
template to hold your heading format. Suppose, for example, that you
want the patient's name and date of birth to appear as the heading at
every page break. You could first create a PATIENT HEADER template as
follows: </p>
<pre></pre>
<hr>
<pre>SORT BY: <b>NAME</b><br>START WITH NAME: FIRST// <br>FIRST PRINT FIELD: <b>"PATIENT NAME: "</b> <br> THEN PRINT FIELD: <b>NAME</b> <br> THEN PRINT FIELD: <b>"DATE OF BIRTH: ";C50</b><br>THEN PRINT FIELD: <b>DATE OF BIRTH</b><br>THEN PRINT FIELD: <br>*************************<br>Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST//<br>STORE PRINT LOGIC IN TEMPLATE: <b>PATIENT HEADER</b><br>Are you adding 'PATIENT HEADER' as a new PRINT TEMPLATE? No// <b>YES </b>(Yes) <br> DEVICE:</pre>
<hr>
<p>Then, at a later time, when you do another print, at the
heading prompt, enter the template name: </p>
<pre> Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// <b>[PATIENT HEADER]</b></pre>
<p>When you enter a PRINT template name such as PATIENT HEADER at
the "Heading (S/C):..." prompt, the format of the template is used as a
replacement for the full normal report heading on each page of your
report (it replaces the full default heading, including title, time,
date, page number, field names, and separator line). Thus, the header,
as defined above, would contain <i>no</i> column headings
and would <i>not</i> be separated from the body of the
report by a horizontal line or even a blank line. You can add these in
yourself as print fields in the template, if you so desire. </p>
<p><b>Custom Footers</b></p>
<p>You can also add footers to the bottom of each page of a
report. First, save the contents of the footer in a template as you do
to create a custom heading. Then, use the template at the "HEADING:"
prompt with a dash ("<b>-</b>") before the first bracket: </p>
<pre>Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// <b>-[PATIENT FOOTER]</b></pre>
<p>You can specify both a heading and a footer like this: </p>
<pre> Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// <b>[PATIENT HEADER]-[PATIENT FOOTER]</b> </pre>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Specifying only a footer at the
"Heading (S/C):" prompt suppresses the default heading. If you need a
header as well as footer, you must use custom templates for both. </p>
<hr>
<h5><big><big><a name="criteria">Printing Sort Criteria in the
Heading or the Footer</a></big></big></h5>
<p>You can print the sort criteria (values used to sort the
report) in the header in two different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the "Heading (S/C):" prompt, entering "<b>C</b>"
prints the sort criteria in the automatically generated report heading.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Use the <a href="#sort_reference" title="Sort Qualifiers" class="bodylink">sort
qualifier</a> <b>;Pa-b</b> to save the FROM and TO
values used to sort a report. Then, in a customized header or footer
(stored in SORT templates), you can retrieve the sort values with
PARAM("a-string"). <br>
<br>
<b>NOTE:</b> For more information, please refer to the
description of the <a href="#pa-b" title="Sort Qualifier ;Pa-b" class="bodylink"><b>;Pa-b</b></a>
sort qualifier.</li>
