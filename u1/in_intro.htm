	 <H4>Inquire</H4> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H5> 
	 <P>Many reports that you print from applications are pre-designed; that is,
		the selection of records, and the fields that print for each record are
		pre-determined by the designer of the application. You simply choose the report
		you would like to print from a menu option, choose an output device, and the
		selected report prints. </P> 
	 <P>You can also create your own reports, however, if you have either VA
		FileMan's print options, or custom-designed application options that take
		advantage of the same VA FileMan features. This chapter introduces one of VA
		FileMan's print options, Inquire to File Entries. </P> 
	 <P>There are two ways you'll have an opportunity to use VA FileMan's
		inquiry capabilities: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>An option that has been set up already to allow you to inquire to
		  entries from a particular file.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>VA FileMan's Inquire to File Entries option, which lets you inquire
		  to any file to which you have access. </LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>In either case, use of VA FileMan's inquire feature is very similar. In
		most cases, the only difference is that with the Inquire to File Entries
		option, you have to choose which file to inquire to. </P> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Option">Inquire to File Entries Option</A></H5> 
	 <P>The quickest way to display the data for one file entry or for a small
		number of entries is to use the Inquire to File Entries option. This option
		lets you choose a set of entries to display, and choose the fields that you
		want to see for each entry. </P> 
	 <P>For example:</P>

	 <P></P> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Captioned">CAPTIONED Output</A></H5> 
	 <P>Choosing CAPTIONED output can be very useful; it prints out <I>all</I>
		fields (that contain data) for each entry in your report. Use it is a quick way
		to select all the fields for each entry in your report. Otherwise you need to
		select each field to print individually, from the list of fields available to
		print in the file. Answering YES to use CAPTIONED output is the fastest way to
		choose what fields to print. </P> 
	 <P><B>The "Include COMPUTED Fields:" Prompt</B></P> 
	 <P>When using CAPTIONED output, you can choose whether to include COMPUTED
		fields, record numbers, both, or neither. The default is to display neither.
		Enter two question marks for detailed Help about responding to this prompt.
		</P> 
	 <P><B><A NAME="audit_trail_prompt">The "DISPLAY AUDIT TRAIL?"
		Prompt</A></B>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="new.gif"
		ALT="New/Updated with VA FileMan V. 22.0" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="11"></P> 
	 <P>If one or more of the fields have been audited, you will see this
		additional question. If you answer YES, then you will see the changes that have
		been recorded for the various fields in the AUDIT file (#1.1), along with the
		current values of the fields.</P> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Templates">SORT Templates</A></H5> 
	 <P>When you choose several entries to display, you will be prompted with
		the following:</P> 
	 <PRE>  STORE THESE ENTRY ID's IN A TEMPLATE:</PRE> 
	 <P>You can <I>save</I> your list of selected entries in a SORT template by
		entering a template name at this prompt. Your list of entries is then saved in
		a SORT template. You can then <I>reuse</I> the list of selected entries in the
		template when you do additional printing from this file in the future. </P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> For more information on using SORT templates, please refer
		to the "<A HREF="pr_intro.htm#sort_templates"
		TITLE="Saving Sort Criteria (SORT Templates)" CLASS="bodylink">Saving Sort
		Criteria (SORT Templates)</A>" topic in the "<A HREF="pr_frm.htm" TARGET="_top"
		TITLE="Print" CLASS="bodylink">Print</A>" chapter in this manual. </P> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Print_fields">Choose Your Own Print Fields</A> <BR> <B>(Don't
		use STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT)</B></H5> 
	 <P>To choose your own fields to output for each entry, answer NO to the
		"STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT?" prompt. You can then choose your own output
		fields. For example, if you only need NAME, DATE OF BIRTH, and PROVIDER
		information about a selected patient, you could request it, as shown in the
		following example: </P>

	 <P></P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> For more information on customizing output print fields,
		please refer to the "<A HREF="pr_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" TITLE="Print"
		CLASS="bodylink">Print</A>" chapter in this manual. It provides detailed
		information about the different choices you can make at the "PRINT FIELD:"
		prompt to display your information in different ways. </P> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Device">Choose Your Own Device </A> <BR> (Don't use STANDARD
		CAPTIONED OUTPUT)</H5> 
	 <P>If you enter YES at the "STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT?" prompt, output is
		sent to the HOME device, which ordinarily is the terminal you are using. To
		send output to a printer, you need to answer NO at the "STANDARD CAPTIONED
		OUTPUT?" prompt. This means you must
		<A HREF="#Print_fields" TITLE="choose your own print fields"
		CLASS="bodylink">choose your own print fields</A>, as described above. Doing
		this allows you to select the output device, however. </P> 
	 <P>If you answer NO to the "STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT?" prompt, you can
		still get CAPTIONED output, however. To do this, choose the CAPTIONED PRINT
		template at the first "PRINT FIELD:" prompt, as shown below. </P> 
	 <P>Enter a left bracket, "<B>[</B>", and the word CAPTIONED. CAPTIONED
		OUTPUT from the template works exactly as if you had answered YES at the
		"STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT?" to request CAPTIONED OUTPUT. </P>
