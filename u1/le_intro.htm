	 <H4>Line Editor</H4> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H5> 
	 <P>The Line Editor is a scrolling mode editor. It is the second of two
		standard editors VA FileMan provides for editing WORD-PROCESSING-type fields.
		The distinguishing characteristic of a Scrolling Mode editor is that you enter
		your text one line at a time, and that you can only edit lines one at a time.
		Because word processing in a scrolling mode interface can be cumbersome, you
		may want to set your Preferred Editor to the
		<A HREF="se_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" TITLE="Screen Editor"
		 CLASS="bodylink">Screen Editor</A>. VA FileMan continues to provide the
		Scrolling-Mode Line Editor, however, for those who prefer it.</P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> To set your default editor, please refer to the "<A
		HREF="wp_swit.htm" TITLE="Choice of Word Processing Editors"
		CLASS="bodylink">Choice of Word-processing Editors</A>" chapter in this manual.
		<BR> <BR> For most people, the
		<A HREF="se_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" TITLE="Screen Editor"
		 CLASS="bodylink">Screen Editor</A> should be your Preferred Editor for
		WORD-PROCESSING fields.</P> 
	 <P><B>Recognizing the Line Editor</B></P> 
	 <P>When you edit a WORD-PROCESSING field, it's easy to see if VA FileMan
		chooses the Line Editor as your editor. If the Line Editor is used, the last
		nine lines of text (if there are that many) are displayed on the screen, with
		numbered prompts at the start of each line. Also, after the text is listed, you
		are prompted with "EDIT Option:". The "EDIT Option:" prompt is where you can
		enter each Line Editor command to work with the text. </P> 
	 <P>For example:</P> 
	  
	 <PRE>HISTORY: 
    1&gt;Owing to poverty in early youth, patient seems not to
    2&gt;have had proper diet. Since achieving economic success,
    3&gt;his diet has been adequate, but traces of original
    4&gt;deficiency remain.

	 <P></P><HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Entering">How to Enter Text in the Line Editor</A></H5> 
	 <P>If no text exists yet in a WORD-PROCESSING field that you're about to
		edit, you'll see the field name followed by "<B>1&gt;</B>". This is the Line
		Editor's prompt for entering word processing text. </P> 
	 <P>For example:</P> 
	  
	 <PRE>Select PATIENT FILE NAME: <B>WAGSTROM,RICHARD</B>  
    Select DIAGNOSIS: ANGINA PECTORIS// <B>B-12 DEFICIENCY</B>
    HISTORY:
      1&gt;</PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>You can now enter the text for Line 1 and press the Enter/Return key.
		This brings you to a prompt "<B>2&gt;</B>" for Line 2, and so forth. Keep
		adding lines until you are done; then, press the Enter/Return key on a blank
		line to finish your edit, as shown below:</P>

	 <H5><A NAME="Revising">Revising Existing Text</A></H5> 
	 <P>To revise the contents of the WORD-PROCESSING field, you need to call up
		each individual line that you want to edit and then edit each line. Here is how
		you can do this: </P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>At the "EDIT Option:" prompt, enter the letter "<B>E</B>" for Edit a
		  Line (Replace __ With __).<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>At the "Edit line:" prompt, enter the number of the line you need to
		  revise.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Now, beneath the "EDIT Option:" and "Edit line:" prompts, you'll see
		  the line of text that you identified by number and you'll see the "Replace"
		  prompt.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Enter a string in the current line to be replaced.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>If the string you enter is found in the current line, you'll set the
		  "With" prompt. Enter a string to replace the original string.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>The line is now updated, and you're asked for another string to
		  replace. If you're done editing the line, simply press the Enter/Return
		  key.</LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P><B>Shortcut: Enter Line Number to Edit at "EDIT Option:" Prompt</B></P> 
	 <P>There's a shortcut to edit a particular line. At the "EDIT Option:"
		prompt, instead of choosing the Edit a Line (Replace __ With __) option and
		entering the line number, just enter the line number instead. You are taken
		directly to the line you specify, and then given the "Replace" prompt to edit
		the line: </P> 
	  
	 <PRE>EDIT Option: <B>5 </B>
    5&gt;was the time of the day that I wnet over to Building 8 and
    Replace <B>wnet</B> With <B>went</B>  Replace <B></B> 
     was the time of the day that I went over to Building 8 and
  Edit line: </PRE> <HR> 
	 <P></P><HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Replace">"Replace...With" Edits: Be Careful</A></H5> 
	 <P>When editing individual lines, you make changes using the
		"Replace...With" dialogue, where you enter an existing string in the line, and
		a new string to replace it with. Be careful as you enter your responses to the
		"Replace" and "With" prompts. Enter enough letters to ensure that the computer
		replaces the desired string of characters. </P> 
	 <P>Here's why this issue is so important. In one line, you may have two
		identical words or you may have two identical sets of characters embedded.
		Since the computer changes only the <B><I>first</I></B> occurrence of any
		series of letters that you enter, review your line carefully before responding
		to the "Replace" prompt. Then enter enough identifying characters to correct
		<I>the specific word or characters</I> you wish to change. Let's look at an
		<I><B>incorrect</B></I> entry to illustrate the point. </P> 
	 <P>In the example that follows, you need to change the sentence in the
		second line from "This example is sample" to the sentence "This example is
		simple."</P> 
	  
	 <PRE>EDIT Option: <B>2 </B>
    2&gt;This example is sample
    Replace <B>ample</B> With <B>imple</B>  Replace <B></B> 
     This eximple is sample
  Edit line: </PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>As you can see from this example, VA FileMan replaced the
		<I><B>first</B></I> occurrence of the "ample" characters. Thus, "example" was
		changed to "eximple" rather than "sample" being changed to "simple" because the
		word "example" came before the word "simple" in the sentence (i.e., it was the
		first occurrence). Obviously, we should have replaced the whole word "sample"
		with "simple" to avoid any confusion. </P> 
	 <P><B>Shortcuts at the "Replace...With" Prompt</B></P> 
	 <P>As with editing long field values, you can replace long strings of
		characters by using ellipses. An ellipsis is three successive periods
		("<B>...</B>"). When editing, you can replace longer strings of characters by
		using an ellipsis at the "Replace" prompt. You can specify ranges of text to
		replace for any line (just as with a long text field) with the ellipsis. </P> 
	 <P>For example, to replace an entire line at a "Replace...With" prompt,
		enter the ellipsis (three periods) at the "Replace" prompt. You are then able
		to replace the entire default with what you entered at the "With" prompt: </P> 
	  
	 <PRE>EDIT Option: <B>5 </B>
    5&gt;care of the boxes.
    Replace <B>...</B> With <B>care to replace the existing supplies.</B>  Replace <B></B>

	 <H4>Advanced Features</H4> 
	 <P>Most of the features of the Line Editor are self-explanatory and simple

	 <H5><A NAME="Transfer">File Transfer (Use When Uploading ASCII
		Text)</A></H5> 
	 <P>The File Transfer from Foreign CPU option from the Utility Sub-Menu lets
		you upload text from another system into your WORD-PROCESSING field text, using
		an ASCII (<I>non-error</I>-correcting) transfer. For example, if you are
		connected from a personal computer (PC), you can use your communication
		software to send a text file. </P> 
	 <P>The file to be transferred must be a text (pure ASCII) file. Most word
		processing programs have a way of saving a document as text (i.e., without
		special formatting information); check your word processor's manual. Also, you
		need to know how to send a text file using your PC's communication software; if
		you're not sure how, check your communications software manual. </P> 
	 <P>To use the File Transfer from Foreign CPU option: </P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>Make sure the file you're transferring is a pure ASCII text
		  file.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>While editing a WORD-PROCESSING field in the Line Editor, choose the
		  Utility Sub-Menu option at the "EDIT Option:" prompt. Then choose the File
		  Transfer from Foreign CPU option from the Utility menu.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>At the "MAXIMUM string length? : (3-245):" prompt, enter maximum
		  string length for lines you are uploading.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>The Line Editor now waits up to 30 seconds for you to initiate an
		  ASCII transfer of the file.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Use your communications software to perform an ASCII upload of the
		  file. All uploaded text is appended to the WORD-PROCESSING field that you are
		  editing.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Once you have finished uploading, it takes 30 seconds of inactivity
		  until the transfer can complete. When done, and after 30 seconds of inactivity,
		  the computer responds "FILE TRANSFER COMPLETE" and you are returned to the
		  "EDIT Option:" prompt.</LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P>The same precautions apply for uploading large quantities of text to the
		Line Editor as apply with the
		<A HREF="se_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" TITLE="Screen Editor"
		 CLASS="bodylink">Screen Editor</A>. In particular, if you need to upload large
		quantities of text quickly, consider switching to an Alternate Editor such as
		Kermit (if installed as an Alternate Editor by your site) which provides
		<I>error</I>-correcting communications protocol. Unlike an ASCII transfer (used
		with the File Transfer option), an error-correcting protocol such as Kermit can
		transfer text and automatically compensate for any communications overflows,
		without losing characters. </P> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Terminator">Text-Terminator-String Change</A></H5> 
	 <P> <B>(Use When Uploading Text with Blank Lines)</B></P> 
	 <P>In the Line Editor, a blank line (null string) signals the end of data
		entry (and returns you to the "EDIT Option:" prompt. Thus, if you plan to
		<I>paste</I> or <I>upload</I> text into the Line Editor from a personal
		computer, any blank lines in the uploaded text have the side effect of
		signaling the end of data entry (prematurely). One way around this is to use
		the
		<A HREF="#Transfer" TITLE="File Transfer from Foreign CPU option"
		 CLASS="bodylink">File Transfer from Foreign CPU option</A>. Another way around
		this problem is to use the Text-Terminator-String Change option on the Utility
		Sub-Menu. This lets you change the text terminator so that some character
		string, rather than a blank line, is what is used to signal the end of data
		entry. </P> 
	 <P>You can change the text terminator to any string of between one and five
		characters; question marks ("<B>?</B>") or up-arrows ("<B>^</B>") are
		<I>not</I> allowed in the string. To finish editing a WORD-PROCESSING field and
		get to the "EDIT Option:" prompt, simply enter your new text terminator string
		instead of pressing the Enter/Return key on a blank line. You should choose a
		text terminator that doesn't appear in your text: "end" would not be a good
		choice, but "EnD" might be. </P> 
	 <P>The new text terminator is <I>not permanent</I>; it remains only as long
		as you are editing a particular WORD-PROCESSING field. You can change it back
		to a null line by entering an at-sign ("<B>@</B>") at the "Text-Terminator:"
		prompt. You can permanently change your default text terminator by changing it
		in your user characteristics as described in the Kernel manuals. </P> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Programmer">Programmer Edit (Edit Lines with M
		Commands)</A></H5> 
	 <P>The Y-Programmer Edit option (invoked by entering the letter <B>Y</B>)
		is only available to users with programmer's access. You can enter a line of M

		the transformed line in variable Y. You can specify the range of lines to be
		transformed by the M code you enter. </P>

	 <P> &lt;expression&gt; IN &lt;file&gt; FILE:&lt;field&gt; </P> 
	 <P>The <B>&lt;expression&gt;</B> or lookup value has several possible
		forms. One way to refer to the field is by entry name. To retrieve text from
		the WORD-PROCESSING PROGNOSIS field of the entry Angina Pectoris in a file
		named DIAGNOSES, you could enter the following: </P> 
	  
	 <PRE>EDIT Option: <B>T  </B>ransfer incoming text after line: <B>1
</B>
  From what text: <B>? </B>

       Select another entry in this file, OR
       use relational syntax to pick up information from a word-
       processing field in another file.
       ex.  &quot;VALUE&quot;:FILE NAME:WORD PROCESSING FIELD NAME

  Do you want the entire TEST list?
  Enter Yes or No: <B>^</B>
  From what text: <B>&quot;Angina Pectoris&quot;:DIAGNOSES:PROGNOSIS </B>
  From line: <B>1 </B>  thru: <B>20 </B>
  ARE YOU SURE? NO// <B>y </B>  (YES)... . .</PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>Alternately, you can use the second syntax to retrieve the same field in
		the same file entry: </P> 
	 <P><IMG SRC="le_1.gif" WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="109"
		ALT="Example of Transferring Text."> </P> 
	 <P>The requested text is identified by the value of the .01 field in quotes
		("Angina Pectoris"). Thus, in this example the <B>&lt;expression&gt;</B> is the
		entry's name. You also specify which lines you want to transfer. If you enter a
		single question mark ("<B>?</B>") at the "From line:" prompt, you can list the
		current numbered lines in the WORD-PROCESSING field. You can then easily choose
		the lines to be transferred. </P> 
	 <P>If the field from which you are transferring text displays text without
		wrapping, you'll receive the following message: </P> 
	  
	 <PRE>WARNING!
  The field you are transferring text from displays text without wrapping.
  The field you are transferring text into may display text differently.

  Do you want to continue?

  Enter Yes or No:</PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>Consider the possibility that the text transferred from the no-wrap
		field may be unreadable, if the field you are transferring into does wrap text.
		For example, a spreadsheet might lose the alignment of its columns. </P> 
	 <P>If the transfer does not succeed, the message <B>&lt;no change&gt;</B>
		is shown. The transfer might fail for several reasons: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Incorrect syntax for the extended pointer.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>An attempted transfer from other than a WORD-PROCESSING DATA TYPE
		  field.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Lack of permission to read the file from which you are trying to
		  extract text.</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>You must have READ ACCESS to transfer text from a file.</P>
