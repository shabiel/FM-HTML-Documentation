	 <h4><big>Adding and Deleting Records</big></h4> 
	 <h5><a name="01_field">.01 Field</a> </h5> 
	 <p>The ".01 field" is the most important field in a file. For the records
		in a file, it usually identifies the record more than any other single field;
		for example, the .01 field of the PATIENT file is NAME. The .01 field of a WARD
		file might be WARD NAME. </p> 
	 <p>Usually in an edit dialogue, the .01 field is the field you are prompted
		for when you choose a record to edit. Typically it's also the first field you
		actually edit once you've chosen the record. </p> 
	 <p>The .01 field plays a role in both adding and deleting entries in a
		file. To <i>add</i> an entry to a file, you usually enter a new value at the
		.01 field's prompt. To <i>delete</i> an entry to a file, you usually enter an
		at-sign ("<b>@</b>") in the entry's .01 field. </p> <hr> 
	 <h5><big><a name="add">How to Add a Record</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>As you may recall from the "<a href="ov_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Overview/Basics" class="bodylink">Overview/Basics</a>" chapter, an entry
		is a complete record in a file. To <i>add</i> a new entry to a file, enter the
		name of the new entry at the "Select..." prompt where you ordinarily choose
		which record in the file to edit: </p> 
	 <p align="center"><img src="ad_1.gif" alt="Example of Adding a New/Updated with VA FileMan V. 22.0 Record in a File." height="93" width="558">
		</p> 
	 <p>This is the prompt for the record's .01 field (see above). If you enter
		a name that does not exist in the file, you are prompted "Are you adding
		'XXXXXXXX' as a new 'ENTRY'?," where "XXXXXXXX" represents the field value and
		"ENTRY" represents the field or file name. If LAYGO is allowed and you answer
		YES to this prompt, VA FileMan will add the new entry to the file. You then go
		on to edit other fields for the new entry.</p> 
	 <p> If a file has one or more data Keys defined (i.e., fields or
		combinations of fields that uniquely identify a record), then those fields must
		also be filled in before the new entry will be added. There must <i>not</i> be
		any other records on the file that have the same values in all of those
		fields.&nbsp;</p> 
	 <p>Finally, there may be a set of required fields (identifiers) for the new
		entry; these must be filled in with values for the new entry to be saved.</p>
	 <hr> 
	 <h5><big><a name="same_name">Adding a Duplicate Record</a> (Use Quotes)</big> </h5> 
	 <p>What if there is already a "HENRY,JOHN" in the PATIENT file, and you
		need to add a second entry with the name "HENRY,JOHN"? Simply entering that
		name at the "Select..." prompt selects the existing entry. To create a
		<i>second</i> HENRY,JOHN entry, even though one with that name <i>already</i>
		exists, enter the entry name you want to add, but with <i>quotation marks</i>
		around it: </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p align="center"><img src="ad_2.gif" alt="Example of Adding a Duplicate Record (sam name)." height="109" width="624"> </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p>See the "<a href="#adding_pointed_to" title="Adding Records at a POINTER TO A FILE" class="bodylink">Adding Records
		at a POINTER TO A FILE Field</a>" topic for instructions on adding entries with
		the same name to pointed-to files from POINTER TO A FILE DATA TYPE fields. </p>
	 
	 <p>If a record has a data Key defined (i.e., fields or combinations of
		fields that uniquely identify a record), and if the data Key contains more than
		one field, then it would be possible to add a second Henry,John without using
		quotes. Suppose the Key fields were the NAME and the DATE OF BIRTH. Then the
		user would be prompted for both NAME and DATE OF BIRTH, and assuming that the
		DATE OF BIRTH of the second Henry,John were different from the existing record,
		VA FileMan would allow the user to add the new Henry,John <i>without</i>
		enclosing the name in quotes.&nbsp;</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><big><a name="deleting">How to Delete a Record</a> </big></h5> 
	 <p>To delete an existing record in a file, enter an at-sign ("<b>@</b>") in
		the record's .01 field. This tells VA FileMan to delete the record. In all
		deletions, you're asked to confirm the deletion before VA FileMan goes ahead
		and deletes the record. Here is an example of deleting a record in a file: </p>
	 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p align="center"><img src="ad_3.gif" alt="Example of Deleting a Record Using the At-Sign." height="123" width="558"> </p> 
	 <p></p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="repointing">Repointing When Deleting Records</a></h5> 
	 <p>What if a record in another file points to the record you're deleting?
		</p> 
	 <p>If you delete a record that is pointed to from another file, this would
		leave a dangling pointer that points to a non-existent entry. To prevent this,
		if the record you delete could be pointed to from another file, you're given
		the opportunity to either delete any pointers to the deleted record, or change
		them all to point to another record. </p> 
	 <p>For example, an entry in the PATIENT file may have a field that points
		to a doctor in the PROVIDER file. If you delete the doctor from the PROVIDER
		file, you should say what should happen to any entries in other files,
		including PATIENT, that point to this doctor. </p> 
	 <p>In the example below, when we delete the MCCOY doctor record, we will
		re-point any entries that had been pointing to MCCOY to point to SMITH. </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p align="center"><img src="ad_4.gif" alt="Example of Repointing Records After Deleting a Record." height="317" width="606"> </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p>When you leave the Enter or Edit File Entries option, the updating is
		done. A report is generated listing all changed entries; you need to specify on
		what device this report should be listed: </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p align="center"><img src="ad_5.gif" alt="Sample Report of Repointed Records." height="218" width="576"> </p> 
	 <p></p> <hr> 
	 <h5><big><a name="adding_pointed_to">Adding Records at a POINTER TO A FILE
		Field</a> </big></h5> 
	 <p>Suppose you're editing a POINTER TO A FILE-type field. This lets you
		choose an entry from another file to point to. If you have LAYGO access to the
		pointed-to file, you can also <i>add</i> new entries to it when editing the
		POINTER TO A FILE field. </p> 
	 <p>For example, suppose you are editing the TITLE field in the NEW PERSON
		file, which is a POINTER TO A FILE type field that "points" to the TITLE file.
		What if you want to choose a TITLE that's not already in the TITLE file? You
		can add it as in the example below: </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p align="center"><img src="ad_6.gif" alt="Example of Adding a New/Updated with VA FileMan V. 22.0 Field Type (LAYGO access)." height="331" width="606">
		</p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p>In this example, after adding WARD CLERK as a new entry, if you go back
		to the TITLE field and enter two question marks ("<b>??</b>") again, WARD CLERK
		would be one of the choices listed for TITLE.</p> 
	 <p><b>Adding Duplicate-Named Entries</b></p> 
	 <p>You can force an entry to be added to the pointed-to file even if an
		entry with the same value already exists in the pointed-to file. To add a
		duplicate-named entry, surround the value to be added with <i>one</i> set of
		quotation marks, like this: </p> 
	 <pre>    POINTER FIELD:  <b>"FORCED NEW ENTRY"</b></pre> 
	 <p>If the POINTER TO A FILE field that you are editing happens to be the
		NAME (#.01) field of the current file, you can add entries to both the current
		file and to the pointed-to file by surrounding your value with <i>two</i> sets
		of quotation marks as follows: </p> 
	 <pre>    POINTER FIELD (.01):  <b>""FORCED NEW ENTRY""</b></pre> <hr> 
	 <h5><big><a name="multiples">Adding and Deleting from Multiples</a></big></h5> 
	 <p>Some special considerations apply when you are editing Multiple-valued
		fields. One example of a Multiple field is the DIAGNOSIS field in the PATIENT
		file. As you may recall from the
		<a href="he_frm.htm" target="_top" title="About Each Field Type" class="bodylink">About Each Field Type</a> chapter in this manual, a Multiple
		is a field in a record that can store multiple Subrecords. In this case, VA
		FileMan must be able to store multiple diagnosis entries for a single patient,
		and it uses a Multiple field to do so:</p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p align="center"><img src="ad_7.gif" alt="Example of Adding Data to a Multiple Field in a Record." border="0" height="306" width="624"> </p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <p>Multiples have .01 fields, just like records at the top level of a file.
		Thus, just as with records at the top level of a file, you select entries in
		the Multiple at the Multiple's "Select..." prompt. You can also add a new entry
		by typing it in at the Multiple's "Select..." prompt. You can delete an entry
		in a Multiple by entering an at-sign ("<b>@</b>") in the existing entry's .01
		field.</p> 
	 <p>Enter a single question mark ("<b>?</b>") at a Multiple's "Select..."
		prompt to retrieve brief Help for the field; enter two question marks
		("<b>??</b>") to choose from the list of entries in the Multiple.</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><big><big><a name="option">Enter or Edit File Entries Option</a></big></big></h5> 
	 <p>In most cases you enter and edit data through application programs.
		Applications are pre-programmed to allow you to edit specific files, and often
		only a subset of the fields in any given file. The application shields you from
		many aspects of editing the file data, such as even knowing the name of the
		file you are working with. Usually, this information is already chosen for you
		by the application. </p> 
	 <p>You can also edit data in a file directly, however, using VA FileMan's
		Enter or Edit File Entries option. Your ability to edit data in any given file
		depends on:</p> 
	 <ul> 
		<li>Whether you have the Enter or Edit File Entries option on your
		  menu.<br><br></li> 
		<li>Whether you have access to edit the file in question.</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <p>The steps to use the Enter or Edit File Entries option are:</p> 
	 <ol> 
		<li>At the "INPUT TO WHAT FILE:" prompt, choose which file to edit. To
		  see what files you have access to, you can enter two question marks
		  ("<b>??</b>") at this prompt: 
		   
		  <pre>INPUT TO WHAT FILE: <b>??</b>
     Choose from:
       335235          CATHY'S DATA            (7 entries)
       335238          PROJECTS               (3 entries)
       335668          WARD HISTORY           (178 entries)

    INPUT TO WHAT FILE: <b>PROJECTS</b>
</pre> <hr> </li> 
		<li><a name="Step2">At</a> the "EDIT WHICH FIELD:" prompt, choose what
		  fields to edit for each file entry. The easiest response is to just accept the
		  default of ALL fields by pressing the Enter/Return key: 
		  <pre>    EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// </pre> 
		  <p>If, however, you want to edit only <i>certain fields</i> (not
			 <i>all</i> fields), answer the "EDIT WHICH FIELD:" prompt with the name (or
			 number) of the FIRST field you want to edit. You can then enter additional
			 fields to edit (when you are done, press the Enter/Return key at the "THEN EDIT
			 FIELD:" prompt). For a list of fields you can edit, enter two question marks at
			 any "EDIT FIELD:" prompt.</p> 
		   
		  <pre>EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// <b>NAME</b>
    THEN EDIT FIELD: <b>PROJECT SHORT DESCRIPTION</b>
    THEN EDIT FIELD: <b>PROJECT ISSUE </b>  (multiple)<br>       EDIT WHICH PROJECT ISSUE SUB-FIELD: ALL// <b></b>
    THEN EDIT FIELD: <b></b>
    Select PROJECTS NAME:
</pre> <hr> </li> 
		<li>You can now edit entries. Choose each entry to edit at the
		  "Select...NAME:" prompt. Each time you choose an entry, you step through each
		  field you specified in <a href="#Step2" title="Step 2" class="bodylink">Step
		  2</a> above. When you are done with editing an entry, you are prompted for
		  another entry to edit at the "Select..." prompt. When you are done editing
		  entries, just press the Enter/Return key.
