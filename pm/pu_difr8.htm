	 <UL> 
		<LI>HELP FRAMES 
		  <P>If an exact match is found for a HELP FRAME entry, only the existing
			 word processing field TEXT and the multiple fields RELATED FRAME and INVOKED BY
			 ROUTINE are deleted from the existing entry. Then, the new entry is brought in
			 on top of the old one.</P> 
		  <P>For all entries brought in by the init, the init loops through the
			 RELATED FRAME multiple and resolves the pointer field RELATED FRAME, which is a
			 pointer back to the Help Frame file. </P> <BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>BULLETINS 
		  <P>If a matching entry is found, the old entry in the Bulletin file is
			 deleted. However, entries in the bulletin's MAIL GROUP multiple (which identify
			 recipients of the bulletin) present on the target system before the install
			 will remain associated with the bulletin after the incoming bulletin is
			 installed.</P> 
		  <P>The init displays each bulletin brought in by the init and reminds
			 the installer to "Remember to add mail groups for new bulletins." </P><BR><BR>
		  </LI> 
		<LI>PACKAGE FILE ENTRIES 
		  <P> The current date/time is stuffed into the field DATE INSTALLED AT
			 THIS SITE, within the VERSION multiple for the current version of the
			 package.</P> 
		  <P>The pointer field PRIMARY HELP FRAME is resolved. </P> <BR><BR></LI>
		
		<LI>PACKAGE PARAMETERS entry in the ORDER PARAMETERS file (an Order Entry
		  file) 
		  <P>Pointer fields DISPLAY GROUP DEFAULT, PROTOCOL TO EXPORT, DEFAULT
			 PROTOCOL, and MENU are resolved. If pointers to the Protocol file cannot be
			 resolved because the pointed-to protocol cannot be found, the init routines add
			 a new entry to the Protocol file (with just a .01 field) in order to resolve
			 the pointer. This is done because PROTOCOLS are exported in a special set of
			 routines (called ONIT routines) that are normally executed as a post-init. </P>
		  <BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>OPTIONS 
		  <P>If a matching entry is found, the entire old entry is not deleted.
			 Only the DESCRIPTION field (a word processing field) and the ITEMS multiple
			 (containing menu items) are deleted from the old entry before the new one is
			 brought in. </P> 
		  <P>For example, if the site has a local lock on an OPTION, and no lock
			 is brought in by the init, the local lock is preserved.</P> 
		  <P>The pointer fields SERVER BULLETIN, SERVER MAIL GROUP, PACKAGE, HELP
			 FRAME and the .01 field of the ITEMS multiple (which points back to the Option
			 file) are all resolved. </P> <BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>SECURITY KEYS 
		  <P>No special processing, except that if a matching entry is found in
			 the target system, it is merged rather than replaced. Note that pointers in the
			 SUBORDINATE KEY multiple are not resolved; so, data should not be exported in
			 that multiple. </P> <BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>FUNCTION 
		  <P>No special processing is done for the Function file. </P>
		  <BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>PRINT, INPUT and SORT TEMPLATES 
		  <P>The only special processing done for these templates is that after
			 they are all installed, compiled PRINT and INPUT templates are automatically
			 recompiled. The init uses the system's preferred routine size from the MUMPS
			 OPERATING SYSTEM file (#.7) when compiling these templates. It is possible that
			 the recipient of the init could already have routines with the same names that
			 the compiling routine will use. Thus, the developer should warn the installer
			 of the routine names that will be used by incoming compiled templates,
			 especially if the developer is sending templates that are not namespaced. </P>
		  <BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>SCREEN TEMPLATES (FORMS) 
		  <P>Any BLOCKS that are pointed-to by FORMS are automatically included
			 in the init routines. The BLOCKS are installed first, with no special
			 processing. Then, the FORMS are installed. Finally, pointers to the Block file
			 from the Form file are resolved. </P> </LI>
