	 <H5>Specifications for Exported Files</H5> 
	 <P>DIFROM next asks the developer whether any data dictionaries will be
		included with the init. The developer must answer YES in order to include
		either DDs or file data. </P> 
	 <P>If the init is being built from a PACKAGE file entry, the developer is
		given the option to display online the information in the FILE multiple from
		the relevant PACKAGE file entry. If the FILE multiple has no entries or if the
		developer is building an init without the PACKAGE file, the developer is
		prompted for a list of files to be included in the init. </P> 
	 <P>If the developer does not want to accept the PACKAGE file information as
		shown or if the init is being built on the fly, DIFROM allows the developer to
		enter or edit the FILE multiple's data. This data specifies how to include the
		files in the init and what installation options the installer will have at the
		time the init is run on the target system. The documentation describing the
		FILE multiple of the PACKAGE file details the questions the developer will see
		and the significance of the answers. </P> 
	 <P>A developer can send only some of the fields from a file, that is, send
		a partial file. The FIELDS multiple contains a list of exported fields when a
		partial file is being exported. Normally, the .01 field of a file is
		automatically exported even if it is not specified in the FIELDS multiple.
		However, the developer has the option of sending or not sending the .01 field
		of File #200 (the NEW PERSON file). If a partial of File #200 is being sent and
		the package does not have Kernel's namespace (XU), the .01 field will be sent
		only if it is specified for export. </P> 
	 <P>If the init is being built from a PACKAGE file entry, DIFROM next loops
		through each of the template multiples. It builds a list of the templates to be
		included in the init. There are multiples for INPUT, PRINT, SORT and SCREEN
		(FORM) templates. The developer uses these multiples to send templates that are
		not within the package's namespace. </P>
