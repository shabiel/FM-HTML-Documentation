	 <H4>Order Entry and DIFROM</H4> 
	 <P>DIFROM for VA FileMan versions 18 and later has been customized to
		support Order Entry. Order Entry inits must export records from the PROTOCOL
		file (#101). This file contains pointers back to itself, similar to the OPTION
		file (#19). Since DIFROM does not currently resolve these pointers, a joint
		effort was made by Order Entry and FileMan developers to support Order Entry
		inits that correctly install the protocols. (See Order Entry documentation for
		details.) </P> 
	 <P>Basically, the process involves the creation of a second set of
		routines, similar to init routines, to export the Order Entry protocols and to
		resolve the pointers in the PROTOCOL file. An Order Entry routine, ORVOM, is
		run to create these routines. The resulting routines are named nmspONI*, the
		ONIT routines. These routine are run at the target site after the init routines
		to install the protocols. </P> 
	 <P>The following considerations pertain to the creation of Order Entry
		inits: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Like regular inits, Order Entry inits can be created either based on
		  an entry in the PACKAGE file (#9.4) or on the fly.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Order Entry's file Order Parameters contains a multiple called
		  PACKAGE PARAMETERS. This multiple controls the export and installation of
		  entries from the PROTOCOL file. Thus, it is used like the PACKAGE file. To
		  export entries from the PROTOCOL file in a sophisticated way, use the PACKAGE
		  PARAMETERS instead of building the export on the fly. <BR> <BR> If the
		  developer is going to use the PACKAGE PARAMETERS, there must be a PACKAGE file
		  entry. Then, create an entry in the PACKAGE PARAMETERS multiple within the
		  ORDER PARAMETERS file (#100.99). The .01 field of this multiple is a DINUMed
		  pointer to the PACKAGE file entry. This implies that the namespace must be the
		  same as that used for the init.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Whether the Order Entry init is built from the PACKAGE PARAMETERS or
		  on the fly, next run the ORVOM routine. The ORVOM routines look at the PACKAGE
		  PARAMETERS (if they exist) or prompt the developer for the names of protocols
		  to be sent. They build ONIT routines that are similar to inits but contain only
		  PROTOCOL file entries. The code generated in these routines installs and
		  resolves pointers on the PROTOCOL file entries. (The ORVOM routines are part of
		  the Order Entry package and are maintained by the Order Entry developers. They
		  were reviewed by the VA FileMan developers.)<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>If the init is being built from an entry in the PACKAGE file, enter
		  the namespaced ONIT routine into the POST-INITIALIZATION ROUTINE field in the
		  PACKAGE file entry. It will be run automatically as a post-init. <BR> <BR> If
		  the init is not being built from the PACKAGE file, the developer must tell the
		  installers to run the ONIT routines manually AFTER they run the init
		  routines.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Now, build the actual init using DIFROM in a normal way as described
		  above. </LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>DIFROM has been modified for Order Entry to automatically pick up the
		entry from the PACKAGE PARAMETERS multiple of the ORDER PARAMETERS file. When
		the init is run any pointers back to the PROTOCOL file that are contained in
		this entry are resolved. See the documentation on "<A
		HREF="pu_difr6.htm" TITLE="running the init" CLASS="bodylink">Running an
		Init</A>" for more information about resolving pointers during package
		installation. </P>
