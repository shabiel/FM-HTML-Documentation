	 <H4>Data Filing (When Is It Performed?)</H4> 
	 <P>With some important exceptions, the database is unaffected during a
		ScreenMan editing session. Changes are filed only at the user's request. </P> 
	 <P>However, there are two situations in which changes to the database are
		made immediately: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>When an entry is deleted from a file or subfile.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>When an entry is added to a file or subfile.</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>When the user attempts to delete an entry, ScreenMan issues a warning
		that deletions are immediate and permanent. Even if the user quits the form
		without saving the changes, the entry is not restored to the database.</P> 
	 <P>Similarly, when the user adds an entry to a file or subfile, that entry
		is immediately added to the database. The entry is added with values for the
		.01 field and all required identifiers. After the entry is added, however,
		changes made to the data for that entry are part of ScreenMan's transaction and
		are filed only at the user's request. Also, in contrast to deletions of
		entries, if the user subsequently quits the form without saving changes,
		entries added during the editing session are deleted. </P> 
	 <P>Because of this, you should consider cross-references that can cause an
		overall state change when the user adds an entry and when ScreenMan
		subsequently deletes the entry. Triggers, bulletins, and MUMPS-type
		cross-references can cause irreversible events to occur. Therefore, when you
		design cross-references for the .01 field and the required identifiers for
		entries the user may add or delete during an editing session, it is best to
		ensure that the kill logic can undo the effects of the set logic. </P>
