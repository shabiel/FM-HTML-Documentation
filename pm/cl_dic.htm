			 <p><b>NOTE:</b> As of Version 22 of VA FileMan, the developer is no
				longer required to set DIC("P"). The only exception to this is for a few files
				that are not structured like a normal VA FileMan file, where the first
				subscript of the data is variable in order to allow several different "globals"
				to use the same DD. An example of this is the VA FileMan Audit files where the
				first subscript is the file number of the file being audited.</p> 
			 <p>This variable is needed to successfully add the FIRST subentry to
				a multiple when the descriptor (or header) node of the multiple does not exist.
				In that situation, DIC("P") should be set equal to the subfile number and
				subfile specifier codes for the multiple. (See the "<a href="gfs_2b.htm" title="File Header" class="bodylink">File Header</a>" section of the Global
				File Structure chapter.) If the descriptor node for the multiple already
				exists, DIC("P") has no effect. </p> 
			 <p>In order to automatically include any changes in the field's
				definition in DIC("P"), it is best to set this variable to the second ^-piece
				of the 0-node of the multiple field's definition in the DD. (See the "<a href="gfs_3b.htm" title="Field Definition" class="bodylink">Field
				Definition</a>" section of the Global File Structure chapter in this manual.)
				</p> 
			 <p>Thus, for example, if file 16150 had a multiple field #9, set
				DIC("P") like this: </p> 
			 <pre>    S DIC("P")=$P(^DD(16150,9,0),"^",2)<br></pre>

			 <p>When doing a lookup using an index for a pointer or variable
				pointer field, this new array allows the user to pass a list of indexes that
				will be used when searching the pointed-to file for matches to the lookup
				value. </p> 
			 <p>For example, if your file (662001) has a pointer field (5) to file
				200 (NEW PERSON), and you wanted the lookup on file 200 to be either by name
				("B" index), or by the first letter of the last name concatenated with the last
				4 digits of the social security number ("BS5" index): . </p> 
			 <pre>    DIC("PTRIX",662001,5,200)="B^BS5"</pre> 
			 <p>Note that if the call allows records to be added to a pointed-to
				file, then the list in the "PTRIX" entry should contain the "B" index. However,
				the "B" index would not need to be included in the list if the first index in
				the "PTRIX" array entry is a compound index whose first subscript is the .01

				screen an entry from selection. DIC("S") must contain an IF statement to set
				the value of $T. Those entries that the IF sets as $T=0 will not be displayed
				or selectable. When the DIC("S") code is executed, the local variable Y is the
				internal number of the entry being screened and the M naked indicator is at the
				global level @(DIC_"Y,0)"). Therefore, to use the previous example again, if
				you wanted to find a male employee whose name begins with SMITH, you would:

			 <p>Currently, if one or more matches are found in the first pass
				through the indexes, then FileMan quits the search, whether or not one of the
				entries is selected. Only if no matches are found in the first pass does
				FileMan continue on to try transforms to the lookup value. This includes
				transforms to find internal values of pointers, variable pointers, dates or
				sets. </p> 
			 <p>Another feature of the "T" flag is that indexes are truly searched
				in the order requested. If, for example, an index on a pointer field comes
				before an index on a free-text field, matches from the pointer field will be
				presented to the user before matches to the free-text field. </p> 
			 <p>When used in combination with the "O" flag, all indexes will be

		start with the letter "S".</p>
