			 <P>The global root of the file from which you want to delete an
				entry. </P> 
			 <P>If you are deleting a subentry, set DIK to the full global root
				leading to the subentry, including all intervening subscripts and the

		  <TD COLSPAN="2" VALIGN="TOP"> 
			 <P>If you are deleting an entry at the top level of a file, set DA to
				the internal entry number of the file entry to delete. For example, to delete
				SAM SMITH, who is entry number 7, from the EMPLOYEE file, stored in the global
				^EMP, write the following: </P> 
			 <PRE>    S DIK=&quot;^EMP(&quot;,DA=7
    D ^DIK
</PRE> 
			 <P>If you are deleting an entry in a subfile, set up DA as an array,
				where DA=entry number in the subfile to delete, DA(1) is the entry number at
				the next higher file level,...DA(n) is the entry number at the file's top
				level. For example, suppose employee JOHN JONES (record #1) has two skill
				entries (subrecords #1 and #2) in a SKILL multiple. To delete the SKILL
				multiple's subrecord #2 you would write: </P> 
			 <PRE>    S DA(1)=1,DA=2,DIK=&quot;^EMP(&quot;_DA(1)_&quot;,&quot;&quot;SX&quot;&quot;,&quot;
    D ^DIK 
</PRE> 
			 <P>where DA is the skill entry number in the subfile and DA(1) is the
				employee's internal entry number in the EMPLOYEE file.</P> </TD> 
		</TR>

	 <H5>Looping to Delete Several Entries</H5> 
	 <P>^DIK leaves the DA-array and DIK defined. So you can loop through a file
		to delete several entries: </P> 
	 <PRE>    S DIK=&quot;^EMP(&quot; F DA=2,9,11 D ^DIK
</PRE> 
	 <P>This deletes entries 2, 9 and 11 from the EMPLOYEE file. </P> 
	 <H5>Deleting Fields from a File</H5> 
	 <P>As discussed in the "<A HREF="gfs_3d.htm"
		TITLE="how to Read an Attribute Dictionary" CLASS="bodylink">How to Read an
		Attribute Dictionary</A>" section of the Global File Structure chapter, each
		attribute dictionary is also in the form of a file. You can therefore use the
		routine DIK to delete a <I>single-valued field</I> (i.e., not a multiple) from
		a file. To do this, the variable DIK is set to the file's data dictionary
		global node; DA is set to the number of the field to be deleted; and DA(1) is
		set to the file number. To delete the field SEX from our EMPLOYEE file example,
		simply write: </P> 
	 <PRE>    S DIK=&quot;^DD(3,&quot;,DA=1,DA(1)=3
    D ^DIK
</PRE> 
	 <P>When you use ^DIK to delete fields from a file, the data is not deleted.
