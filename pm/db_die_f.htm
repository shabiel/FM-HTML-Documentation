				provided in this way. These "user interface" cross-references are fired by the
				Filer with the rest of the cross-references after the data editing is complete.
				Thus, they cannot have their desired effect of providing the user with
				information during the editing session. However, they may have the undesired
				effect of overwriting user-entered values. This type of cross-reference must be
				removed from the DD as part of the preparation for using the DBS. Also, if the
