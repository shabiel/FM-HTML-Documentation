	 <H4>Introduction</H4> 
	 <P>The VA FileMan Database Server (DBS) is an Application Programmer
		Interface (API) for accessing data attributes and data in VA FileMan files. The
		principal function of this API is to separate database access from user
		presentation. In Classic FileMan's roll and scroll mode, the interaction with
		the end user was closely tied to the code that actually changed the database.
		Whenever FileMan needed information from the user, a Read was done; whenever
		FileMan needed to present information to the user, a Write was done. </P> 
	 <P>However, with FileMan's DBS calls, no Writes to the current device are
		done. Interaction with the user is managed by the client application. Package
		developers can manage user interaction from within their own code and can call
		FileMan whenever interaction with the database is needed. The DBS calls are
		used to update the database in a non-interactive mode. Information needed by
		the FileMan routines is passed through parameters rather than through
		interactive dialog with the user. Any information that needs to be displayed to
		the end user is passed by FileMan back to the calling routine in arrays. </P> 
	 <P>This separation of data access from user I/O makes possible the
		construction of alternative front-ends to the VA FileMan database (for example,
		a windowed Graphical User Interface (GUI)). In addition, this API can be the
		basis for data access by applications running outside M. </P> 
	 <P>The first section in this chapter (How to Use) describes the conventions
		used in the DBS API. The next section (How the DBS Communicates) offers a
		detailed description of the way DBS calls return information to the client
		application in arrays. Finally, the individual calls are described, including
		input parameters, output, and examples of their use. </P>
