		  <TD VALIGN="TOP"> 
			 <P>(Optional) This variable can be set to an interval in minutes
             that the Screen Editor should automatically save the text for the
             user. It can be an integer between 1 and 120. If set to 0, no
             autosave occurs. The setting takes effect for only the current
             invokation of the Screen Editor and can be changed by the user via
             the &lt;PF1&gt;&lt;PF1&gt;S key sequence. The default value of
             DDWAUTO is 0. This variable is killed by FileMan. </P>

		  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><b>DDWTAB</b></TD> 
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP"> 
			 <P>(Optional) This variable indicates to the Screen Editor the
             initial tab stop positions. The setting takes effect for only the
             current invokation of the Screen Editor and can subsequently be
             changed by the user via the &lt;PF1&gt;&lt;PF1&gt;&lt;Tab&gt; key
             sequence. </P> 
			 <P>To set individual tab stops, set DDWTAB to a series of numbers
             separated by commas; for example, </P> 
             <pre>    DDWTAB = &quot;4,7,15,20&quot;</pre>
			 <P>sets tab stops at columns 4, 7, 15, and 20. To set tab stops at
             repeated intervals after the last stop, or after column 1, type the
             interval as +n; for example, </P> 
             <pre>    DDWTAB = &quot;10,20,+5&quot;</pre>
			 <P>sets tab stops at columns 10, 20, 25, 30, 35, etc. </P> 
			 <P>If not passed, the Screen Editor assumes DDWTAB =
             &quot;+8&quot;; that is, it initially sets tab stops at columns 1,
             9, 17, 25, etc. This variable is killed by FileMan. </P>

				enters text, the input line will not be broken to DWLW-characters until after
				the Enter/Return key is pressed. Thus, if DWLW=40 and the user types 90
				characters before pressing the Enter/Return key, the text would be stored in
				three lines in the global. If this variable is not set, the default value is
				245. This variable is always killed by FileMan. </P> </TD>
