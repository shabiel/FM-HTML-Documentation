	 <H5><A NAME="Form_structure">Form Structure</A></H5> 
	 <P>A form is a series of screens that are presented to the user. A form
		contains one or more pages, a page contains one or more blocks, and a block
		contains one or more fields. </P> 
	 <P>Structurally, the form is an entry in the FORM file (#.403). The FORM
		file contains a PAGE multiple, and the PAGE multiple contains a BLOCK multiple.
		The .01 field of the BLOCK multiple is a pointer to the BLOCK file (#.404). The
		BLOCK file contains a multiple for fields. </P> 
	 <P>Because of this structure, blocks in the BLOCK file are reusable; that
		is, the same block can be placed on more than one page and on more than one
		form. </P> 
	 <P>Each block in the BLOCK file that contains VA FileMan fields has a DD
		(data dictionary) Number. Each block can contain fields from only one file or
		subfile, as determined by this DD Number. </P> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Linking">Linking Pages of a Form</A></H5> 
	 <P>When a form is first invoked and the user is presented with the first
		page, conceptually, the user is at the top level of the form. When the user
		goes to the next or previous pages, the user remains at the top level. Only at
		this level can the user exit or quit the form or save changes made during the
		editing session. </P> 
	 <P>When the user opens up a subpage, however, the user has descended a
		level. At this level, and at lower levels, the user can only close the current
		page, or issue the Refresh command to repaint the screen; the user cannot exit
		or quit the form or save any changes. </P> 
	 <P>Pages on a form can be linked together in a variety of ways. The
		following lists the places where links can be defined: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><B>Pages at the same level</B> 
		  <UL> 
			 <LI>The Next Page property of a page<BR><BR></LI> 
			 <LI>The Previous Page property of a page<BR><BR></LI> 
			 <LI>The DDSBR variable in the Branching Logic of a field or in Pre
				and Post Actions</LI> 
		  </UL> <BR><BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Pages at different levels</B> 
		  <UL> 
			 <LI>The Parent Field property of a page<BR><BR></LI> 
			 <LI>The Subpage Link property of a field<BR><BR></LI> 
			 <LI>The DDSSTACK variable in the Branching Logic of a field</LI> 
		  </UL> </LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>Both the Next Page and Previous Page properties link pages at the same
		level. The user can go to the next and previous pages by pressing
		<B>&lt;PF1&gt;&lt;ARROW DOWN&gt;</B> and <B>&lt;PF1&gt;&lt;ARROW UP&gt;</B>,
		respectively. Pages linked via the Next and Previous page links must be regular
		pages; they cannot be "pop-up" pages. The
		<A HREF="sf_ddsbr.htm" TARGET="display" TITLE="DDSBR variable"
		 CLASS="bodylink">DDSBR variable</A>, discussed in the "<A HREF="sf_propg.htm"
		TARGET="display" TITLE="Field Properties" CLASS="bodylink">Field
		Properties</A>" section, can be used to take the user to another page under
		conditions you specify. </P> 
	 <P>Both the Parent Field and Subpage Link properties allow you to take the
		user to a subpage at a lower level when the user presses the Enter/Return key
		at a field on the parent page. The subpage can be either a regular or a
		"pop-up" page. A "pop-up" page is usually preferable since it gives users a
		better indication that they have descended a level and must close the subpage
		to return to the previous level. After the user closes the subpage, ScreenMan
		automatically returns to the previous level -- that is, to the parent page from
		where the branch occurred. </P> 
	 <P>The difference between the Parent Field property and the Subpage Link
		property is where the link is defined. The Parent Field property is defined
		with the subpage and indicates the field from which the branch should occur.
		The Subpage Link property, on the other hand, is defined with the field and
		indicates the subpage to which the branch should occur. In a sense, then, the
		difference between these two properties is the direction of the "pointer."
		Parent Field points from the subpage to the field, and Subpage Link points from
		the field to the subpage. Where you choose to define the link is a matter of
		personal preference. However, the disadvantage of defining the link in the
		Subpage Link property is that the block on which the field is defined may not
		be reusable on other forms, since the link points to a specific page on the
		form. </P> 
	 <P>You must use either the Parent Field or the Subpage Link property to
		link a multiple field on a form to a subpage that contains the fields within
		the multiple. </P> 
	 <P>The
		<A HREF="sf_ddsst.htm" TARGET="display" TITLE="DDSSTACK variable"
		 CLASS="bodylink">DDSSTACK variable</A>, discussed in the "<A
		HREF="sf_propg.htm" TITLE="Field Properties" CLASS="bodylink">Field
		Properties</A>" section, can also be used to link a field to a subpage. It
		behaves just like the Parent Field and Subpage Link properties, but because it
		is set in M code in the Branching Logic property of a field, DDSSTACK lets you
		branch conditionally. </P>
