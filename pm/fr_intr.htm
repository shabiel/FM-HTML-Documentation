    <H5>What is VA FileMan?</H5>
   <P>VA FileMan creates and maintains a database management
	 system that includes features such as: </P>
  <UL>
    <LI>A report writer<BR><BR></LI>
    <LI>A data dictionary manager<BR><BR></LI>
    <LI>Scrolling and screen-oriented data entry<BR><BR></LI>
    <LI>Text editors<BR><BR></LI>
	  <LI>Programming utilities<BR><BR></LI>
    <LI>Tools for sending data to other systems<BR><BR></LI>
    <LI>File archiving</LI>
  </UL>
   <P>VA FileMan can be used as a standalone database, as a set of interactive
   or "silent" routines, or as a set of application utilities; in all modes, it
   is used to define, enter, and retrieve information from a set of
   computer-stored files, each of which is described by a data dictionary.</P>
   <P>VA FileMan is a public domain software package that is developed and
   maintained by the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is widely used by VA
   medical centers and in clinical, administrative, and business settings in
   this country and abroad.</P>  <P>The VA FileMan Development Team encourages
   you to send to them questions and comments about the completeness and
   accuracy of this manual and suggestions for its improvement.</P>
  <H5>Functional Description</H5>
  <p>VA FileMan
	 functions as a Database Management System (DBS) with powerful Application
	 Program Interfaces (APIs) and provides useful utilities for application
	 developers. VA FileMan can be used as a database management system for data
	 entry and output and its DBS calls are used in application packages with
	 tools like Filegrams, auditing, archiving, and statistics.</p>
  <ul>
	 <li><strong>Database Management System (DBS)</strong>&mdash;As a database
	 management system (DBS), VA FileMan supports the entering, editing, printing,
	 searching, inquiring, transferring, cross- referencing, triggering, and
	 verifying of information. It includes special functions to create new files,
	 modify an existing file, delete entire files, reindex files, and create or
	 edit templates.</li>
   <li><strong>Application Program Interfaces (APIs)</strong>&mdash; As an
   application program interface (API), the Database Server routines manage
   interactions between the application software and the database management
   system “silently” (i.e., without writing to the current device). Package
   developers use DBS calls to update the database in a non-interactive mode.
   Information needed by the VA FileMan routines is passed through parameters
   rather than through interactive dialogue with the user. Information to be
   displayed to the user is passed by VA FileMan back to the calling routine in
   arrays. This separation of data access from user interaction makes possible
   the construction of alternative front-ends to the VA FileMan database (e.g.,
   a windowed Graphical User Interface [GUI]).</li>
	 <li><strong>Utilities</strong>&mdash;As a set of utilities, VA FileMan
	 provides tools like the Filegram, which is a tool that moves file records
	 from one computer to another; archiving, which is a tool that stores data
	 onto an offline storage medium; auditing, which is a tool that tracks changes
	 to data in a field or to the file’s structure (the data dictionary); and
	 statistics, which is a tool that accumulates totals and subtotals of
	 individual fields.</li>
  </ul>
    <p> VA FileMan has several levels of users, ranging from a data entry person
    who enters, edits, inquires, or prints information, to a software
    application developer or Information Resource Management (IRM) staff member
    who uses all of its database management system features and utilities. </p>
    <p>
      Developers should consider this manual the list of VA FileMan-supported
      (“documented”) routines and Application Program Interface (API) calls
      eligible for developer use. These routines and APIs provide the following
      (to list a few):
      <ul>
        <li>File lookup and reindexing</li>
        <li>Data edit, print, display, and retrieval</li>
        <li>Filegrams</li>
        <li>File entry deletion</li>
        <li>A reader program</li>
        <li>Data dictionary deletion</li>
        <li>Word-processing</li>
        <li>Conversion of date and time values</li>
        <li>Software package export</li>
        <li>Linked option processing</li>
      </ul>
