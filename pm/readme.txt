VA FileMan Programmer Manual
Version 22.0 (with updates)
Package Release Date: March 1999

============================================================================
Installation Instructions

This manual is maintained and updated on the Technical Service web server.
If you can connect to this server through TCP/IP, it's probably best to
access this manual directly on the Software Service web server - this way,
you'll always access the latest, updated version of the information in the
manual.

However, in an environment where you can't connect to the Software Service
web server, you may want to use this manual. We are providing a zipped
version of the manual so that it can be downloaded for use on other 
computers.

Installation Instructions

   1. This manual is designed for systems that support long filenames
      (i.e., names longer than the traditional DOS "8.3" naming restrictions). 

   2. When you download the ZIP file, you should create a separate
      directory for the manual and unzip the ZIP file in the separate
      directory. Once unzipped, the "Table of Contents" page is INDEX.HTML. 

   3. If you are downloading other manuals in the VA FileMan documentation set
      as well, set up a directory structure on the target disk, as follows:

      ....\pm\ (for Programmer Manual)
      ....\u1\ (for Getting Started Manual)
      ....\u2\ (for Advanced User Manual)

      Where "...." is above, you can have any directory path, as long as
      the three directories are placed at the same directory level. Unpack
      each manual in the appropriate directory. This enables cross-manual
      hyperlinks to work.

   4. If your file system does not support long filenames, use INDEX.HTM
      instead of INDEX.HTML as your starting file. The "Contents" links 
      on various pages in the manual link to "INDEX.HTML", so these links 
      won't work if your system doesn't support long filenames.
