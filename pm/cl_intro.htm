	 <H4>Introduction</H4> 
	 <P>Certain modules within VA FileMan are callable by other M routines. This
		is true of these Classic FileMan routines which are referred to as "Callable
		Routines" and are described in this chapter. </P> 
	 <P>Database Server (DBS) calls are also callable by other M routines.
		However, these "silent" calls differ from the Classic FileMan routines in that
		they separate interaction with the database from interaction with the end-user.
		In Classic FileMan's roll and scroll mode, interaction with the end-user was
		closely tied to the code that actually changed the database, but, with
		FileMan's DBS calls, no Writes to the current device are done. Interaction with
		the user is managed by package developers from within their own code, calling
		FileMan whenever interaction with the database is needed. These DBS calls are
		described in the "<A HREF="dba_frm.htm" TARGET="_top"
		TITLE="Database Server (DBS)" CLASS="bodylink">Database Server (DBS)</A>"
		chapter in this manual. </P> 
	 <P>When using both the Classic FM callable routines and the DBS calls, you
		must keep in mind the variable-naming conventions listed below. If you have
		local variables that you wish to preserve by a call to any of the routines
		described here, you should be sure to give them multi-character names beginning
		with letters other than D. </P> 
	 <P>It is your responsibility, as a programmer, to clean up (kill)
		documented input and output variables used in a FileMan call, when the call is
		finished. The few situations in which your input variables are killed during
		the FileMan call are mentioned in the following sections. </P> 
	 <P>After making a programmer call, always check for failed calls. For
		example, when using ^DIC for lookups, always check for the error condition Y=-1
		before doing anything else; when using the reader, always check DUOUT, DIRUT,
		and DTOUT before doing anything else. When a call provides a way to check for
		error conditions, it means that there are some circumstances where the call
		won't succeed! Checking for errors after such a call allows you to handle the
		errors gracefully.</P> <P>&nbsp;</P>
