	 <P>As mentioned in the "<A HREF="../u2/fn_frm.htm" TARGET="_top"
		TITLE="VA FileMan Functions" CLASS="bodylink">VA FileMan Functions</A>" chapter
		of the "<A HREF="../u2/index.htm" TARGET="_top"
		TITLE="VA FileMan V. 22.0 Advanced User HTML Manual" CLASS="bodylink">VA
		FileMan Advanced User Manual</A>," as a programmer in FileMan you can create
		your own computed-expression functions. In some ways, a function can be thought
		of as an OUTPUT transform that can work on any field. For example, you may have
		a preference for seeing many dates displayed as 20-7-69, rather than the JUL
		20,1969 format that FileMan typically produces. Since this date is internally
		stored in the form 2690720 (see the description of
		<A HREF="cl_dt.htm" TITLE="%DT" CLASS="bodylink">%DT</A>), you could write a
		line of code that took the internally stored format in the variable X and
		transformed it using: </P> 
	 <PRE>
    +$E(X,6,7)_&quot;-&quot;_+$E(X,4,5)_&quot;-&quot;_$E(X,2,3)
</PRE> 
	 <H5>Function File Entries</H5> 
	 <P>This is exactly what you are allowed to do when you edit the FUNCTION
		file (#.5) using the Enter or Edit File Entries option. </P> 
	 <P>To continue the above example, you could create a DASHDATE function
		which could then be used by any user to display date-valued fields and
		expressions in the DAY-MONTH-YEAR format as follows: </P> 
	  
	 <PRE>Select OPTION: <B>ENTER AND EDIT FILES</B> 
    INPUT TO WHAT FILE: <B>FUNCTION</B> 
    EDIT WHICH ATTRIBUTE: ALL// <B> 
</B>    Select COMPUTED-FIELD FUNCTION: <B>DASHDATE</B>
      ARE YOU ADDING 'DASHDATE' AS A NEW COMPUTED-FIELD FUNCTION? <B>Y </B>  (YES)
    MUMPS CODE: <B>S X=+$E(X,6,7)_&quot;-&quot;_+$E(X,4,5)_&quot;-&quot;_$E(X,2,3)</B> 
    EXPLANATION: <B>PRINTS DATE IN &quot;DD-MM-YY&quot; FORMAT</B> 
    DATE-VALUED: <B>NO</B> 
    NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS: <B>1</B>
    WORD-PROCESSING: <B></B>
</PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>Notice that the MUMPS CODE field contains code to transform the variable
		X (the argument of the function) into a different X. If two arguments were
		required for the function, the first would be found in the variable X1 and the
		second in X. Although the new function being created here takes a date-valued
		argument, it is not itself considered to be date-valued since it doesn't
		produce values that look like the standard FileMan internal representation of a
		date. If this function was only meaningful in a word processing context, you
		would put a W at the "WORD-PROCESSING:" prompt. </P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> If there is an output transform on a field, the function
		code is applied to the field after it has been transformed. In most cases, if a
		field has an output transform, you should therefore use the syntax
		FUNCTION_NAME(INTERNAL(FIELD_NAME)), rather than FUNCTION_NAME(FIELD_NAME).</P>
	 
	 <P>A function can also be defined as taking no arguments. This is very
		similar to the special variables in M like $I and $H. For example, you could
		define a function like BELL as follows: </P> 
	  
	 <PRE>Select COMPUTED-FIELD FUNCTION: <B>BELL</B> 
       ARE YOU ADDING A NEW COMPUTED-FIELD FUNCTION? <B>Y </B>  (YES) 
    MUMPS CODE: <B>SET X=$C(7) </B>
    EXPLANATION: <B>CAUSES A 'BEEP' TO OCCUR ON OUTPUT</B>
    DATE-VALUED: <B>NO
</B>    NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS: <B>0</B> 
    WORD-PROCESSING: <B></B>
</PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>Users could then embed "beeps" in output templates by entering: </P> 
	 <PRE>
    FIRST PRINT FIELD: <B>BELL</B>
</PRE> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> No parentheses are shown for a function with no arguments.
		</P> 
	 <P>You can delete a function in the usual way by deleting the NAME of the
		function. Such deletions do not harm any computed fields that already have been
		created using the function. However, you may not edit the computed field unless
		you remove reference to the deleted function. </P> 
	 <P><B>WARNING:</B> Due to concatenation, do not use IF, FOR or QUIT
		statements when defining functions. Also, any variables you introduce within a
		function's code (but not X, X1, etc.) should be NEWed. </P> 
	 <P>The Function file already contains several functions. Consult the "<A
		HREF="../u2/fn_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" TITLE="VA FileMan Functions"
		CLASS="bodylink">VA FileMan Functions</A>" chapter of the "<A
		HREF="../u2/index.htm" TARGET="_top"
		TITLE="VA FileMan V. 22.0 Advanced User HTML Manual" CLASS="bodylink">VA
		FileMan Advanced User Manual</A>" for a description of the functions exported
		with VA FileMan. </P>	 <P>&nbsp;</P>
