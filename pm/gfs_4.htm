	 <H4>File Entries (Data Storage)</H4> 
	 <P>Each entry in a file corresponds to a positive-valued key subscript, the
		internal entry number, of the file global. All data pertaining to an entry will
		be stored in global nodes descendent from that subscript. The value of the .01
		field of an entry is always stored in the first ^-piece of subscript zero,
		descendent from the internal entry number subscript. Thus, for entry #1, an
		employee named John Jones, you would have: </P> 
	 <PRE>    ^EMP(1,0)=&quot;JONES,JOHN^&quot;
</PRE> 
	 <P>Suppose you want to store the employee's sex in the second ^-piece of
		subscript zero, and date of birth in the third ^-piece, and department in the
		fourth ^-piece. You would have: </P> 
	 <PRE>    ^EMP(1,0)=&quot;JONES,JOHN^M^2341225^3&quot;
</PRE> 
	 <P>Notice that the entry for the employee's department in this file is a
		number. This means that the employee's department is internal entry number 3 in
		the Department file; and to find the employee's department, you would have to
		consult that file. The 7-digit number representing the employee's date of birth
		is FileMan's way of internally representing 12/25/1934. </P> 
	 <P>How is multiple-valued data, such as skill, stored? There can be one or
		five or ten skills on file for a given employee and they obviously cannot all
		be stored (in the general case) in a single subscript. VA FileMan's answer is
		to make the skills list a subfile within the employee entry. This requires
		adding subscripts beyond the first internal key subscript which are different
		in value from the zero subscript that stores each employee's name, sex, and
		birth date. For example, if John Jones currently has two (free-text) skills on
		file, you can consider those to be entries #1 and #2 in a two-entry file, which
		can extend at a lower level from any unused subscript, say from SX as shown
		below: </P> 
	 <PRE>    ^EMP(0)=&quot;EMPLOYEE^3I^9^3&quot;
    ^EMP(1,0)=&quot;JONES,JOHN^M^2341225^3&quot;
    ^EMP(1,&quot;SX&quot;,0)=&quot;^3.01A^2^2&quot;
    ^EMP(1,&quot;SX&quot;,1,0)=&quot;TYPING&quot;
    ^EMP(1,&quot;SX&quot;,2,0)=&quot;STENOGRAPHY&quot;
</PRE> 
	 <P>Notice that the data global ^EMP has ^EMP(1,"SX",0) for the skill
		multiple. The zero node, except for the first ^-piece, has the same structure
		as ^EMP(0). The second ^-piece is the subfile ^DD number. This tells FileMan
		which subsidiary dictionary to use for the data stored in this node. The actual
		data (the employee's skills in our example) are stored in the next lower level
		of subscripting. In the same manner that entries in the EMPLOYEE file have
		internal entry numbers, entries in the multiple field also have internal entry
		numbers in the subfile. In the example above, TYPING is the first entry and
		STENOGRAPHY the second. </P>
