	 <H4>Security at the File Level</H4> 
	 <P>There are two methods of controlling access to files:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><A HREF="#access_code" TITLE="Access Code Security on Files"
		  CLASS="bodylink">Access Code Security on Files</A><BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><A HREF="#FAS"
		  TITLE="File Access Security (Formerly Part 3 of Kernel)" CLASS="bodylink">File
		  Access Security (Formerly Part 3 of Kernel)</A></LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P> On a particular system only one method is in effect at a particular
		time. If File Access Security has been installed, it controls file-level
		security. Otherwise, access is controlled by Access Codes. Obviously, if you
		are using VA FileMan without Kernel, only Access Code security is possible.
		</P> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="access_code">Access Code Security on Files</A></H5> 
	 <P>The Access Code is a string of characters that correspond to functional
		data access categories. For example,<B> <I>A</I></B> might correspond to
		entry/editing of Administrative Data, a lower case <I><B>a</B></I> might
		correspond to viewing of Administrative data, <I><B>F</B></I> might correspond
		to entering or editing of Fiscal data, and <I><B>f</B></I> to viewing of Fiscal
		data. </P> 
	 <P>Typically, you go through a password-checking signon process before
		using VA FileMan. During signon, you are identified by the system and your
		Access Code is set. For example, it might be equal to <I><B>Aaf</B></I>, if you
		are identified as someone entitled to view and change Administrative data, but
		only to view (search and print) Fiscal data. If you lack any such security
		clearance, the default value of the Access Code entry is simply null. </P> 
	 <P>These Access Codes are used to control access to files in six different
		ways: </P> 
	 <TABLE BORDER="1"
	  SUMMARY="Access Code Controls Table (control and description)" WIDTH="100%"> 
		<TR> 
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>Access Code</B></TD> 
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>Description</B></TD> 
		</TR> 
		<TR> 
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><B><A NAME="read">READ</A></B></TD> 
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP">Controls use of the file by Print File Entries, Search
			 File Entries, Inquire to File Entries, Statistics, List File Attributes, and
			 Transfer File Entries (transfer-from file) options. </TD> 
		</TR> 
		<TR> 
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><B><A NAME="write">WRITE</A></B></TD> 
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP">Controls use of Enter or Edit File Entries and
			 Transfer File Entries (transfer-to file) options. </TD> 
		</TR> 
		<TR> 
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><B><A NAME="delete">DELETE</A></B></TD> 
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP">Controls deletion of an entire entry in the Enter or
			 Edit File Entries or the Transfer Entries options. </TD> 
		</TR> 
		<TR> 
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><B><A NAME="laygo">LAYGO</A></B></TD> 
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP">Controls creating a new entry within the Enter or Edit
			 File Entries option. You must have LAYGO as well as WRITE access to a file to
			 add new entries. Additionally, you must have WRITE access on the field level to
			 all required identifiers. </TD> 
		</TR> 
		<TR> 
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><B><A NAME="dd">DD</A></B></TD> 
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP">Controls use of the Modify File Attributes and Utility
			 Functions (Data Dictionary) options.</TD> 
		</TR> 
		<TR> 
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><B><A NAME="audit">AUDIT</A></B></TD> 
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP">Controls the setting of auditing characteristics and
			 the deletion of audit trails. </TD> 
		</TR> 
	 </TABLE> 
	 <P>All these controls are based on the value of the Access Code. When you
		access a file, under any of these options, you will not be allowed to access
		any file that is protected unless your current Access Code either equals an
		at-sign ("<B>@</B>") or contains at least one character in common with the
		protection code string of the file. The at-sign ("<B>@</B>") is generally
		reserved for use by programmers; it gives programmer access. </P> 
	 <P>Any new file that you create with a code string in your Access Code will
		automatically be given READ, WRITE, DELETE, LAYGO, and AUDIT Access Codes equal
		to that code string. To change these codes later, use the Edit File option of
		the Utility Functions submenu. Be sure when doing so that your own Access Code
		contains the codes you want to add or equals the at-sign ("<B>@</B>").</P> <HR>
	 
	 <H5><A NAME="FAS">File Access Security (Formerly Part 3 of Kernel)</A></H5>
	 
	 <P>VA FileMan also has the ability to perform a lookup into a user's record
		and see if a specific file has been assigned. If your Systems Manager has run
		the special conversion to have access controlled by the ACCESSIBLE FILE
		Multiple in the NEW PERSON file (#200), then access to a file is not based on
		an Access Code. Rather, a lookup is done in your record to see if you are
		allowed access to the file in question. If your VA FileMan Access Code is the
		at-sign ("<B>@</B>"), you will be allowed access to all files, even if this
		special conversion has been performed. </P> 
	 <P>Access to files is granted to you by the Systems Manager who uses
		Kernel's File Access Security system. (See the Kernel manuals for detailed
		information about File Access Security.) </P>
