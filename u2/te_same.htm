	 <P>You can use the Transfer File Entries option to merge two entries that
		are in the same file. To do this: </P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>Identify the input and output file as the same<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Identify the two entries</LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P>Data values are then transferred from the FROM entry to the TO entry.
		The following example shows the simple dialogue: </P> 
	  
	 <PRE>Select OPTION: <B>TRANSFER ENTRIES</B>   

Select TRANSFER OPTION: <B>?</B>
 ANSWER WITH TRANSFER OPTION NUMBER, OR NAME
CHOOSE FROM:
   1           TRANSFER FILE ENTRIES
   2           COMPARE/MERGE FILE ENTRIES

Select TRANSFER OPTION: <B>1 </B>  TRANSFER FILE ENTRIES 
 
INPUT TO WHAT FILE: <B>PATIENT</B>
TRANSFER FROM WHAT FILE: <B>PATIENT</B>
TRANSFER DATA INTO WHICH PATIENT: <B>RECIPIENT,ROGER</B>
TRANSFER DATA FROM PATIENT: <B>SENDER,SAM</B> 
WANT TO DELETE THIS ENTRY AFTER IT'S BEEN TRANSFERRED?  NO//</PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>If the TO entry (Roger Recipient in our example) already has a value on
		file for a given field, that value will be preserved (i.e., it will <I>not</I>
		be overwritten by the corresponding field value in the FROM entry). This rule
		applies to word processing data fields also. If the recipient has any text on
		file, corresponding text from the sender's entry is not merged with it. Thus,
		if you decide to delete the FROM entry (Sam Sender here), you may lose some
		data. </P> 
	 <P>In the case of distinct Multiple-valued subfields, merging will take
		place. The subentries in the FROM entry would be added to the Multiple in the
		TO entry. Further, if two subentries have the same .01 value and if any of the
		subfields are blank in the TO entry, the FROM subentry's data will be placed in
		the blank subfield. In this way, data is added to Multiples in the same way
		that it is added to files. </P> 
	 <P>For example, suppose DIAGNOSIS is the label of the .01 field of a
		Multiple and AGE AT ONSET is a subfield in that Multiple. If Roger Recipient
		has a DIAGNOSIS of "Angina" and Sam Sender has one of "Diabetes", Recipient
		ends up with both "Angina" and "Diabetes". Further, if both Recipient and
		Sender had "Angina", but Recipient had no AGE AT ONSET for that subentry and
		Sender did have one, the Sender's AGE AT ONSET data for "Angina" would be
		transferred to Recipient. </P> 
	 <P>The following example illustrates the transfer of data values from one
		entry to another in more detail. (These two entries will also be used in the
		discussion of the Compare/Merge File Entries option.) Before the transfer, the
		Inquire to File Entries option displays these two entries from the SCHOLAR
		file: </P>
