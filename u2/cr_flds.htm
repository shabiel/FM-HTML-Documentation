	 <h3><a name="navskip">Creating Files and Fields</a></h3>
	 <hr class="hrstyle"> 
	 <h4>Creating Fields</h4> 
	 <p>For any file, you can create fields describing logically related data
		that pertains to entries in that file. When created, every file automatically
		receives one field: a
		<a href="cr_mod.htm#name_field" title="NAME field" class="bodylink">NAME
		field</a> (the #.01 field). You must explicitly define any other fields. All
		such definitions are made (and changed) with the Modify File Attributes option.
		</p> 
	 <p>When you create a file, after you give the new file a name, you are
		asked: </p> 
	 <pre>    Select FIELD:</pre> 
	 <p>Enter a new field name and respond with YES when VA FileMan asks: </p> 
	 <pre>    Are you adding 'xxxxxxxx' as a new FIELD?</pre> 
	 <p>The "xxxxxxxx" represents the name of the field you entered. After
		answering YES to this prompt, you are now ready to specify what sort of data
		the new field will contain. A field can only be <i>one</i> type of data; the
		choices are listed in the following section.</p> 
	 <h5><a name="data_types">Field Data Types</a></h5> 
	 <p>There are nine Data Types:</p>

	 <p>You are asked for the Data Type of any field you are creating. You must
		pick one of these nine choices. Data validation checks are then asked depending
		on the Data Type entered. For some Data Types, a default "HELP" prompt is
		automatically composed.</p> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> You can review and change a file's field attributes easily
		by running the Modify File Attributes option in Screen Mode. For examples of
		entering a field attributes in Screen Mode, please refer to the "Examples of
		File and Field Creation" topic that follows.</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="Screenmode">Screen Mode Field Editing</a>&nbsp;</h5> 
	 <p>When using the Modify File Attributes option you can make your field
		entries in the traditional Scrolling Mode or choose to create, modify, or
		review a file's field attributes easily by running the Modify File Attributes
		option in Screen Mode.</p> 
	 <p> To make your entries in Screen Mode, simply press the Enter/Return key
		to accept the default response at the "DO YOU WANT TO USE THE SCREEN-MODE
		VERSION? Yes//" prompt.</p> 
	 <p>The following example illustrates using Screen Mode when editing the .01
		field of the ORDER file (#100): </p> 
	 <pre> </pre> <hr> 
	 <pre>Select OPTION: <b>MOD</b>IFY FILE ATTRIBUTES  <br>DO YOU WANT TO USE THE SCREEN-MODE VERSION? Yes// <b></b>  (Yes)<br><br>MODIFY WHAT FILE: <b>ORDER</b> <br><br>Select FIELD: <b>.01 </b>  ORDER #</pre> <hr> 
	 <p>You will then be taken into Screen Mode where you can edit the
		properties of the field, as shown below:</p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <center>
		<img src="firstscr.JPG" alt="Example of Editing Properties of a Field in Screen Mode." height="455" width="640"> </center> 
	  
	 <p>Using the Screen Mode version of this option, after entering the field
		name or number (e.g., .01 field) after the "Select FIELD:" prompt, you are
		presented with a
		<a href="../u1/sm_frm.htm" target="_top" title="ScreenMan" class="bodylink">ScreenMan</a> form (screen) that can be reviewed and edited
		like any other. In this example, the most important field on this screen is the
		Data Type field in the upper right corner; it is a required entry. In this
		example, required entries in Screen Mode are indicated by a caption with a
		different color and an underline.</p> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> Screen Mode highlights the captions for required fields
		with an underline. However, depending on your terminal or terminal emulator
		software and your personal preferences, the form of the highlight can vary
		(e.g., some emulators will highlight required field captions in reverse video,
		a different color, with an underline, or any combination of highlights).</p> 
	 <p>In this case, the Data Type field has been defined as
		<a href="#Numeric" class="bodylink" title="NUMERIC Data Type">NUMERIC</a> and
		is <i>not editable</i> as indicated by the message displayed near the bottom of
		the screen (i.e., "NOTE THAT THIS FIELD'S DEFINITION IS NOT EDITABLE"); this is
		because a programmer has previously edited the definition in a special way.
		However, unlike the Data Type field, the value of the HELP-PROMPT field (i.e.,
		"Enter the Order number."), which is the message that is displayed to users
		when they enter a single question mark ("<b>?</b>") while editing the ORDER #
		field, can be edited. The DESCRIPTION and TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION fields are
		multi-line <a href="#Word" title="WORD-PROCESSING Data Type" class="bodylink">WORD-PROCESSING</a> fields; to edit them, press the
		Enter/Return key and a separate screen opens (i.e., a "pop-up" window). The
		DESCRIPTION is displayed to users who enter two question marks ("<b>??</b>")
		while editing the ORDER # field. The TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION, however, is for
		internal documentation only.</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="Date/Time">DATE/TIME Data Type</a></h5> 
	 <p>A Data Type defined as DATE/TIME allows you to enter a minimum and
		maximum date. You can also indicate whether the date can be entered with an
		imprecise date (e.g., JUL 1969) or with the time-of-day (e.g., JUL 20@4). VA
		FileMan does not accept dates before 1700.</p> 
	 <p>For example, when defining a DATE/TIME Data Type, you are asked the
		following questions: </p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select FIELD: <b>DATE OF BIRTH</b>
  Are you adding 'DATE OF BIRTH' as a new FIELD? No// <b>Y </b>  (Yes)<br><br>DATA TYPE OF DATE OF BIRTH: <b>DA</b>TE/TIME <br>EARLIEST DATE (OPTIONAL): <b>1/1/1860 </b>  (JAN 01, 1860) <br>LATEST DATE: <b>1963 </b>  (1963) <br>CAN DATE BE IMPRECISE (Y/N):  YES// <b></b>
CAN TIME OF DAY BE ENTERED (Y/N):  NO// <b></b>  NO</pre> <hr> 
	 <p> If you reply YES to the "CAN TIME OF DAY BE ENTERED (Y/N): NO//"
		prompt, you would then be asked "CAN SECONDS BE ENTERED?".</p> 
	  
	 <pre>WILL DATE OF BIRTH FIELD BE MULTIPLE:  No// <b></b>  (No) <br>IS DATE OF BIRTH ENTRY MANDATORY (Y/N):  NO// <b>Y </b>  YES<br>...<br>'HELP'-PROMPT:  TYPE A DATE BETWEEN 1/1/1860 AND 1963 <br>           Replace <b></b>
DESCRIPTION:
  1&gt; <b></b>
</pre> <hr> 
	 <p>A default Help prompt is automatically written for you with the
		DATE/TIME Data Type. You can change this prompt using the "Replace ... With"
		syntax. </p> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> This Help information is displayed when the user inputs a
		single question mark ("<b>?</b>") when editing this field.</p> 
	 <p>You can review and change a file's field attributes easily by running
		the Modify File Attributes option in
		<a href="#Screenmode" title="Screen Mode" class="bodylink">Screen Mode</a>.
		Thus, we have also provided an
		<a href="cr_ex.htm#Date/Time" title="example of entering a DATE/TIME Data Type in Screen Mode" class="bodylink">example of entering a DATE/TIME Data Type in Screen
		Mode</a>.&nbsp;</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="Numeric">NUMERIC Data Type</a></h5> 
	 <p>A Data Type defined as NUMERIC requires you to enter the lowest and
		highest values allowed, the maximum number of decimal digits allowed, and to
		state whether dollar values are allowed (e.g., $33).</p> 
	 <p>For example, when defining a NUMERIC Data Type, you are asked the
		following questions: </p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select FIELD: <b>AGE AT ONSET</b>   <br>  Are you adding 'AGE AT ONSET' as a new FIELD? No// <b>Y </b>  (YES)<br> <br>DATA TYPE OF AGE AT ONSET: <b>NUMERIC</b> <br>INCLUSIVE LOWER BOUND: <b>0</b>
INCLUSIVE UPPER BOUND: <b>100</b> <br>IS THIS A DOLLAR AMOUNT (Y/N):  NO// <b></b></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>If you answer YES at the "IS THIS A DOLLAR AMOUNT (Y/N):" prompt, VA
		FileMan would allow users to precede input data with a dollar sign ("<b>$</b>")
		and show up to two decimal places. </p> 
	  
	 <pre>MAXIMUM NUMBER OF FRACTIONAL DIGITS: 0// <b></b> <br>WILL AGE AT ONSET FIELD BE MULTIPLE? No// <b></b>  (No)    <br>IS AGE AT ONSET ENTRY MANDATORY (Y/N): NO// <b></b>  NO<br>....<br>'HELP'-PROMPT:  Type a Number between 0 and 100, 0 Decimal Digits <br>           Replace <b></b>
DESCRIPTION:
  1&gt; <b></b></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>A default Help prompt is automatically written for you with the NUMERIC
		Data Type. You can change this prompt using the "Replace ... With" syntax. </p>
	 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> This Help information is displayed when the user inputs a
		single question mark ("<b>?</b>") when editing this field.</p>

		Mode</a>.&nbsp;</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="Set">SET OF CODES Data Type</a></h5> 
	 <p>A Data Type defined as a SET OF CODES can be used to restrict a user to
		just a few possible values (e.g., YES or NO). When defining a SET OF CODES Data
		Type, enter a valid code and a translation of what each code means. The user
		can enter the code, the full meaning, or a portion of the full meaning. If the
		field is set up to require only a one-character response (as shown in the
		example below), this Data Type can simplify the user's data entry. </p> 
	 <p>VA FileMan has only a limited amount of space to store the codes and
		their external values. If the limit is exceeded, you are told "TOO
		MUCH!!--SHOULD BE A 'POINTER', NOT 'SET'." The SET OF CODES Data Type is
		sometimes referred to as a SET. </p> 
	 <p>For example, when defining a SET OF CODES Data Type, you are asked the
		following questions: </p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select FIELD: <b>SEX</b>
  Are you adding 'SEX' as a new FIELD? No// <b>Y </b>  (Yes)  <br><br>DATA TYPE OF SEX: <b>SET</b> OF CODES<br>INTERNALLY-STORED CODE: <b>m</b>  WILL STAND FOR: <b>MALE</b> <br>INTERNALLY-STORED CODE: <b>f</b>  WILL STAND FOR: <b>FEMALE</b> <br>INTERNALLY-STORED CODE: <b></b>
WILL SEX FIELD BE MULTIPLE: No// <b></b>  (No) <br>IS SEX ENTRY MANDATORY (Y/N):  No// <b>Y </b>  YES<br>... <br>'HELP'-PROMPT: <b></b>
DESCRIPTION:
  1&gt; <b></b></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>In this example, "<b>m</b>" stands for Male and "<b>f</b>" stands for
		Female. Numbers as well as alphabetic characters can be used. </p> 
	 <p>You can review and change a file's field attributes easily by running
		the Modify File Attributes option in
		<a href="#Screenmode" title="Screen Mode" class="bodylink">Screen Mode</a>.
		Thus, we have also provided an
		<a href="cr_ex.htm#Set" title="example of entering a  SET OF CODES Data Type in Screen Mode" class="bodylink">example of entering a SET OF CODES Data Type in Screen
		Mode</a>.&nbsp;</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="Free">FREE TEXT Data Type</a></h5> 
	 <p>A Data Type defined as FREE TEXT allows you to enter the maximum and
		minimum allowable string length of the FREE TEXT data. You can also enter an M
		PATTERN MATCH that input data will have to match.</p> 
	 <p>For example, when defining a FREE TEXT Data Type, you are asked the
		following questions: </p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select FIELD: <b>DIAGNOSIS</b>
  Are you adding 'DIAGNOSIS' as a new FIELD? No// <b>Y </b>  (Yes)<br><br>DATA TYPE OF DIAGNOSIS: <b>FREE TEXT</b> <br>MINIMUM LENGTH: <b>3</b>
MAXIMUM LENGTH: <b>30</b> <br>(OPTIONAL) PATTERN MATCH (IN 'X'): <b></b></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>The PATTERN MATCH is written in M code. If input data violates the
		PATTERN MATCH or the Minimum/Maximum lengths, the data is not accepted and the
		user is shown the Help prompt information. </p> 
	  
	 <pre>WILL DIAGNOSIS FIELD BE MULTIPLE? No// <b>Y </b>  (Yes)<br>IS DIAGNOSIS ENTRY MANDATORY(Y/N): NO// <b></b>  NO<br>SHOULD USER SEE AN "ADDING A NEW DIAGNOSIS?" MESSAGE FOR NEW<br>   ENTRIES (Y/N): <b>N </b>  NO<br>HAVING ENTERED OR EDITED ONE DIAGNOSIS, SHOULD USER BE ASKED <br>   ANOTHER (Y/N): <b>Y </b>  YES </pre> <hr> 
	 <p>With these specifications, the user is not given a confirming message
		when new subentries are added to the Multiple. The user is allowed to enter
		several diagnoses in a row for a given patient. </p> 
	  
	 <pre>....<br>....<br>'HELP'-PROMPT:  Answer must be 3-30 characters in length.<br>           Replace <b></b>
DESCRIPTION:
  1&gt; <b></b></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>A default Help prompt is automatically written for you with the FREE
		TEXT Data Type. You can change this prompt using the "Replace ... With" syntax.
		</p> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> This Help information is displayed when the user inputs a

		Mode</a>.&nbsp;</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="Word">WORD-PROCESSING Data Type</a></h5> 
	 <p>A Data Type defined as a WORD-PROCESSING field allows entry of unlimited
		free-text data. The data can be edited, formatted, and printed with word
		processing text editors. </p> 
	 <p>NOTE: For a description of VA FileMan's native text editors, please
		refer to the "<a href="../u1/se_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Screen Editor" class="bodylink">Screen Editor</a>" and "<a href="../u1/le_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Line Editor" class="bodylink">Line Editor</a>" chapters in
		the "<a href="../u1/index.htm" target="_top" title="VA FileMan V. 22.0 Getting Started HTML Manual" class="bodylink">VA
		FileMan Getting Started Manual</a>."</p> 
	 <p>For example, when defining a WORD-PROCESSING Data Type, you are asked
		the following questions: </p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select FIELD: <b>HISTORY</b>
  Are you adding 'HISTORY' as a new FIELD? No// <b>Y </b>  (Yes) <br><br>DATA TYPE OF HISTORY: <b>WORD-PROCESSING</b>
SHALL THIS TEXT NORMALLY APPEAR IN WORD-WRAP MODE? Yes// <b></b>  (Yes)<br>....<br>....<br>'HELP'-PROMPT: <b>SUBJECTIVE NARRATIVE OF PATIENT'S PROBLEM HISTORY</b>
DESCRIPTION:
  1&gt; <b></b></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>If you answer YES to the "SHALL THIS TEXT NORMALLY APPEAR IN WORD-WRAP
		MODE" question, text is automatically wrapped at word boundaries to fit in the
		column in which it is being printed. Usually, this is the preferred way to
		print text. However, when it is important that lines of text be printed exactly
		as they were entered, answer NO to the "SHALL THIS TEXT NORMALLY APPEAR IN
		WORD-WRAP MODE" question. Thus, text is output in no-wrap mode. You would
		probably want a spreadsheet or a restaurant menu printed in no-wrap mode. </p> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> If the column in which no-wrap text is being printed is too
		short to accommodate the line of text, your printer may break the line in the
		middle of words or otherwise destroy the formatting of the text. </p> 
	 <p>You can review and change a file's field attributes easily by running
		the Modify File Attributes option in
		<a href="#Screenmode" title="Screen Mode" class="bodylink">Screen Mode</a>.
		Thus, we have also provided an
		<a href="cr_ex.htm#word" title="example of entering a  WORD-PROCESSING Data Type in Screen Mode" class="bodylink">example of entering a WORD-PROCESSING Data Type in Screen
		Mode</a>.&nbsp;</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="Computed">COMPUTED Data Type</a></h5> 
	 <p>When a Data Type is defined as COMPUTED its value is determined at the
		time the field is accessed. This computation is based on an expression stored
		in the data dictionary. The field value (or data) itself is not stored in the
		data dictionary. The COMPUTED expression is constructed using field names,
		literals or constants, functions, and operators. These elements are explained
		fully in the "<a href="ce_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Computed Expressions" class="bodylink">Computed Expressions</a>" chapter in this manual. <br> <br>
		<b>NOTE:</b> The functions referred to above are VA FileMan functions stored in
		the FUNCTION file (#.5), not M functions. A developer with programmer access
		can also enter M code in a COMPUTED field. The M code must set the variable "X"
		to the COMPUTED field value.</p> 
	 <p>For example, when defining a COMPUTED Data Type, you are asked the
		following questions:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select FIELD: <b>AGE</b>
  Are you adding 'AGE' as a new FIELD? No// <b>Y </b>  (Yes)<br><br>DATA TYPE OF AGE: <b>COMPUTED</b>  <br><br>'COMPUTED-FIELD' EXPRESSION: <b>TODAY-(DATE OF BIRTH)\365.25</b>

....
NUMBER OF FRACTIONAL DIGITS TO OUTPUT (ONLY ANSWER IF NUMBER-VALUED): <b>2</b>
</pre> <hr> 
	 <p>For this example, we assume the DATE OF BIRTH field was previously
		created. Thus, we can reference it in the " 'COMPUTED-FIELD' EXPRESSION". Also,
		the "NUMBER OF FRACTIONAL DIGITS TO OUTPUT" question is asking whether you
		should enter the number of digits that should normally appear to the right of
		the decimal point when this field is displayed.</p> 
	  
	 <pre>SHOULD VALUE ALWAYS BE INTERNALLY ROUNDED TO 2 DECIMAL PLACES? No// <b>Y<br></b>  (Yes)<br>WHEN TOTALLING THIS FIELD, SHOULD THE SUM BE COMPUTED FROM<br>       THE SUMS OF THE COMPONENT FIELDS? No// <b></b>  (No)<br>LENGTH OF FIELD: 8// <b></b> <br></pre> <hr>

	 <h5><a name="Pointer">POINTER TO A FILE Data Type</a></h5> 
	 <p>A Data Type defined as a POINTER TO A FILE requires you to enter the
		name or number of the pointed-to file and that file must already exist (defined
		previously).</p> 
	 <p>For example, when defining a POINTER TO A FILE Data Type, you are asked
		the following questions: </p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select FIELD: <b>RELIGION</b>
  Are you adding 'RELIGION' as a new FIELD? No// <b>Y </b>  (Yes)<br><br>DATA TYPE OF RELIGION: <b>POINTER</b> TO A FILE  <br>POINT TO WHICH FILE: <b>RELIGION</b> <br></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>The file that is pointed to must already exist on your system. If you
		enter a single question mark ("<b>?</b>") at the "POINT TO WHICH FILE:" prompt,
		you will be presented with a list of the available files. </p> 
	  
	 <pre>SHOULD 'ADDING A NEW RELIGION FILE ENTRY' ("LAYGO") <br>BE ALLOWED WHEN ANSWERING THE 'RELIGION' QUESTION?  No// <b></b>  (No)  </pre> <hr> 
	 <p>By answering NO to this prompt, users who are editing patient data are
		not able to add a new entry on the fly to the RELIGION file. This prompt
		depends on whether you have LAYGO access to the file or not.</p>

	 <pre>Are you adding 'PROVIDER' as a new VARIABLE-POINTER? No// <b>Y </b>  (Yes)<br> <br>VARIABLE-POINTER:  PROVIDER// <b></b>
MESSAGE: <b>Staff Provider</b>  <br>ORDER: <b>1</b>  <br>PREFIX: <b>S</b>
SHOULD USER BE ALLOWED TO ADD A NEW ENTRY: <b>NO </b>  NO</pre> <hr> 
	 <p>The MESSAGE is part of the online Help associated with the
		VARIABLE-POINTER field when a single question mark ("<b>?</b>") is entered
		during editing. In this example, the PROVIDER file MESSAGE is associated with
		"Staff Provider." </p> 
	 <p>The several pointed-to files are searched based on their ORDER. In this
		example, since the ORDER for the PROVIDER VARIABLE-POINTER is one, the PROVIDER
		file is the first file searched.</p> 
	 <p>The PREFIX field is used to reference a particular pointed-to file. To
		see the entries in a particular file, you would enter that file's PREFIX
		followed by a period and a question mark at the VARIABLE-POINTER's field name
		(e.g., in this example, entering "<b>S.?</b>" would give you the option to list
		the entries in the PROVIDER file). If you want to refer to only one of the
		several pointed-to files, put that file's PREFIX followed by a period at the
		VARIABLE-POINTER's field name (e.g., in this example, entering "<b>S.</b>"
		would refer you to the PROVIDER file).</p> 
	 <p>By answering NO to the "SHOULD USER BE ALLOWED TO ADD A NEW ENTRY:"
		prompt, the user is <i>not</i> allowed to add new entries on the fly to the
		PROVIDER file (the same as the RELIGION field entered as a
		<a href="cr_ex.htm#Pointer" title="POINTER TO A FILE" class="bodylink">POINTER
		TO A FILE</a>). If you had answered YES, then new entries could be added to the
		PROVIDER file.</p>

	 <p>In this example, a second VARIABLE-POINTER was created to the PERSON
		file (#16). By answering YES to the "SHOULD USER BE ALLOWED TO ADD A NEW
		ENTRY:" prompt, users who are editing patient data are allowed to add entries
		to the PERSON file. </p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select VARIABLE-POINTER: <b></b></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>You stop identifying files for a VARIABLE-POINTER by simply pressing the
		Enter/Return key without any additional entries at the "Select
		VARIABLE-POINTER:" prompt.</p> 
	  
	 <pre>WILL PROVIDER FIELD BE MULTIPLE?  No// <b></b>  (No) <br>IS PROVIDER ENTRY MANDATORY (Y/N):  NO// <b></b>  NO<br>'HELP'-PROMPT: <b></b>
DESCRIPTION:
  1&gt; <b></b></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>After entering both VARIABLE-POINTERS, when you enter a single question
		mark ("<b>?</b>") at the "PROVIDER" field prompt, you will see the following
		Help message:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>PROVIDER: <b>?</b>
     Enter one of the following:
       S.EntryName to select a Staff Provider
       O.EntryName to select a Other Provider
 
     To see the entries in any particular file type &lt;Prefix.?&gt; 
</pre> <hr> 
	 <p>In this example, if you simply enter a name at the "PROVIDER:" prompt,
		then the system will search each of the VARIABLE-POINTER field files for the
		name you have entered. If a match is found, the system will ask you if it is
		the correct entry. However, if you know the file the entry should be in, then
		you can speed processing by using the following syntax to select an entry: </p>
	 
	 <ul> 
		<li><b>PREFIX.entry name</b><br><br></li> 
		<li><b>MESSAGE.entry name</b><br><br></li> 
		<li><b>File Name.entry name</b></li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> You do <i>not</i> need to enter the entire file name or
		message to direct the lookup. Using the first few characters will suffice.</p> 
	 <p>You can review and change a file's field attributes easily by running
		the Modify File Attributes option in
		<a href="#Screenmode" title="Screen Mode" class="bodylink">Screen Mode</a>.
		Thus, we have also provided an
		<a href="cr_ex.htm#Variable" title="example of entering a  VARIABLE-POINTER Data Type in Screen Mode" class="bodylink">example of entering a VARIABLE-POINTER Data Type in Screen
		Mode</a>.&nbsp;</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="MUMPS">MUMPS Data Type</a></h5> 
	 <p>Those with programmer access can define a field as a MUMPS Data Type.
		This Data Type is designed specifically to contain executable M code. The code
		entered into this kind of field is verified to be valid M code that conforms to
		VA programming standards.</p> 
	 <p>MUMPS Data Type fields are usually used in files that are part of
		developer tools systems. For example, the OPTION file (#19) is part of the MENU
		MANAGEMENT system used in the VA for assigning menus and associated actions to
		each computer user. The ENTRY ACTION field on the OPTION file is defined as a
		MUMPS type field. This field allows a developer who is creating an option to
		enter M code to do any setup and initialization that is needed before the end
		user can do the action allowed by the option.</p>
