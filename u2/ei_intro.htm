	 <H4>Import and Export Tools Introduction</H4> 
	 <P>If you want to use an application like Microsoft Excel to manipulate
		data stored in a VA FileMan file, you need some way to exchange that data
		between VA FileMan and your application. VA FileMan provides the Import and
		Export Tools for this purpose.</P> 
	 <P>Suppose, for example, that you want to use Microsoft Word's print merge
		utility to print a form letter to a list of recipients that is maintained in a
		VA FileMan file. You can use VA FileMan's <B>Export Tool</B> to export the list
		of recipients from the VA FileMan file to Microsoft Word. Once you've done
		this, you can use Word to generate your form letters based on the exported
		list.</P> 
	 <H5>What Applications Can You Exchange Data With?</H5> 
	 <P>In theory, you can exchange data with any application that supports
		<A HREF="ei_delim.htm" TITLE="Delimited" CLASS="bodylink">Delimited</A> or
		<A HREF="ei_fixed.htm" TITLE="Fixed-length" CLASS="bodylink">Fixed-length</A>
		ASCII data exchange. Many applications do, using a variety of formats.
		Typically, you can expect the ability to import and export data with the
		following types of applications:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Databases<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Spreadsheets<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Statistical and Analysis Programs (SAS, SPSS, etc.)<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Vertical Applications<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Word Processor (data records, <I>not</I> word processing text)</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> You can export data records to a word processor, which
		often uses data records for functions such as print merges. You can't use the
		Import or Export Tools to exchange word processing fields from VA FileMan
		files, however.</P> 
	 <H5>How Data is Moved Between Applications</H5> 
	 <P>Movement of data between applications that do not "speak the same
		language" is a complex process because it involves coordinating activities in
		different computer applications and often in multiple computing environments.
		</P> 
	 <P>VA FileMan's <B>Import</B> and <B>Export Tools</B> use ASCII data
		exchange. It is the oldest and most widely supported way of exchanging data
		between applications. Data for a particular record or group of records can be
		transported in one of two standard formats:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><A HREF="ei_delim.htm" TITLE="Delimited"
		  CLASS="bodylink">Delimited</A><BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><A HREF="ei_fixed.htm" TITLE="Fixed-length"
		  CLASS="bodylink">Fixed-length</A></LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>To <B><I>export</I></B> data from a VA FileMan file, use the <B>Export
		Tool</B> to create an ASCII data file containing exported records. The exported
		data is formatted in such a way that it can be recognized by the particular
		foreign application. The ASCII data file can then be imported into the foreign
		application. </P> 
	 <P>To <B><I>import</I></B> data to a VA FileMan file, use your foreign
		application to generate an ASCII data file containing records in either
		delimited or fixed-length formats. Then use the <B>Import Tool</B> to load
		those records into the VA FileMan file you specify.</P> 
	 <H5>Dependency on Correct Data Communication</H5> 
	 <P>For import or export of data to succeed, the data must be passed
		correctly on all communication pathways between VA FileMan and the foreign
		application. A glitch in the communication of data can cause data exchange to
		fail.</P> 
	 <P>For example, suppose the foreign application expects the fields in
		records you are exporting to be separated (or "delimited") by the Tab character
		(<B>&lt;TAB&gt;</B>). The Export Tool can output a <B>&lt;TAB&gt;</B> between
		each field's data value. However, if you use a communication program's screen
		capture facility to create a file of the exported data and if that
		communication program automatically changes <B>&lt;TAB&gt;</B>s into a certain
		number of spaces to align text, the exported data will be corrupted and the
		import will fail.</P> 
	 <P>You should be familiar with your importing or exporting application and
		with any communications programs that you are using. Knowledge of all the
		applications involved, starting with VA FileMan and its Import and Export
		Tools, increases the likelihood of a successful transfer of data.</P>
