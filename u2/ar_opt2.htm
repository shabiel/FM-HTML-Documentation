	 <P>Use the Add/Delete Selected Entries option to add entries to or delete
		them from the archiving activity. This is an easy way to clear out unwanted
		entries or add needed ones before archiving. </P> 
	 <P>This option uses the Inquire to File Entries option to display the
		selected entries and then allows you to add or delete an entry. If you add or
		delete an entry to an established archiving activity, then the status of the
		activity will change to EDITED. </P> 
	 <P>The Add/Delete Selected Entries option will <I>not</I> allow you to edit
		an archiving activity list after the Write Entries to Temporary Storage option
		has been done. If you need to change the archiving activity list after writing
		to temporary storage, you must cancel that archiving activity and start a new
		one. </P> 
	 <P>When using this option, you first select the archiving activity number
		that you want to modify. You can also identify the archiving activity by its
		file number or file name. Then, choose the entry that you want to add or
		delete. </P> 
	 <P>Here is an example in which an entry is being added to the archiving
		activity: </P>

	 <P>If you enter two question marks ("<B>??</B>") at the prompt where you
		select the entry for addition or deletion, a list of the file's entries is
		displayed. Those that are already part of the archiving activity are identified
		by "*ON ARCHIVE LIST*". The "ADD this entry TO the ARCHIVAL SELECTION? YES//"
		question appears if you have selected an entry not already on the list for
		archiving. A "DELETE ..." question appears if you have selected an entry
		already on the list.</P> <P>&nbsp;</P>
