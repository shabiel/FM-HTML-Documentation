	 <H4>Setting Up Alternate Editors</H4> 
	 <P>VA FileMan supplies two editors, the Line and Screen Editors, for
		entering and changing text in WORD-PROCESSING-type fields. Other editors can be
		made available by using the ALTERNATE EDITOR file (#1.2). Entries in this file
		specify the M code used to call the Alternate Editor and to restore the VA
		FileMan environment after work in the editor is complete. </P> 
	 <P>The user can choose an editor in two ways:</P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>The PREFERRED EDITOR field in the NEW PERSON file (#200) is a pointer
		  to the ALTERNATE EDITOR file (#1.2). Any entry in the ALTERNATE EDITOR file can
		  be selected as a Preferred Editor. Then, whenever a WORD-PROCESSING-type field
		  is presented for editing, the user is automatically switched into this
		  Preferred Editor.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>From the Line Editor, the user can switch to any of the editors in
		  the ALTERNATE EDITOR file temporarily by using the Editor Change option on the
		  UTILITIES submenu. After exiting the chosen editor, the user is returned to the
		  Line Editor. </LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> The "<A HREF="../u1/wp_swit.htm" TARGET="display"
		TITLE="Choice of Word-processing Editors" CLASS="bodylink">Choice of
		Word-processing Editors</A>" chapter of the "<A HREF="../u1/index.htm"
		TARGET="_top" TITLE="VA FileMan V. 22.0 Getting Started HTML Manual"
		CLASS="bodylink">VA FileMan Getting Started Manual</A>" contains additional
		information about selecting editors. </P> 
	 <H5>ALTERNATE EDITOR File Entries</H5> 
	 <P>The requirements of the ALTERNATE EDITOR file's fields are explained in
		the following example of the creation of an entry in that file: </P> 
	  
	 <PRE>Select OPTION: <B>ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES</B>  

INPUT TO WHAT FILE: <B>ALTERNATE EDITOR </B>  (2 entries)
EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// <B></B>
Select ALTERNATE EDITOR: <B>VMSEDT</B>
  Are you adding 'VMSEDT' as a new ALTERNATE EDITOR (the 3RD)?  No// <B>YES </B>  (Yes)
</PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>An entry needs to be added to the ALTERNATE EDITOR file. The NAME of
		every entry must begin with a unique character. This name is used to select the
		editor.</P> 
	 <P>The required ACTIVATION CODE FROM DIWE field contains M code that will
		invoke the Alternate Editor. In this case, a routine supplied by Kernel that
		invokes the VMS editor is called:</P> 
	 <PRE>
    ACTIVATION CODE FROM DIWE: <B>G ^XTEDTVXD</B>
</PRE> 
	 <P>Usually, this code will need to extract the word processing data from
		the WORD-PROCESSING-type field, present it to the Alternate Editor, and return
		the edited text to the WORD-PROCESSING-type field. DBS calls should be used to
		retrieve and file the text. </P> 
	 <P>For example, if the text to be edited were in Field #56 of File #1234
		use the following Data Retriever call to extract the text for entry 789:</P> 
	 <PRE>
    S MYFDA="^TMP(""MYDATA"",$J)" D GETS^DIQ(1234,"789,",56,"",MYFDA)
</PRE> 
	 <P>The text returns in nodes descendent from ^TMP("MYDATA",$J,1234,
		"789,",56).</P> 
	 <P>After editing is complete, you can file the data from the same global
		array by using the following commands:</P> 
	 <PRE>
    S MYFDA="^TMP(""MYDATA"")" D FILE^DIE("","MYFDA")
</PRE> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> For more details of the use of these calls, please refer to
		the descriptions of the
		<A HREF="../pm/db_diqgs.htm" TARGET="display" TITLE="Data Receiver"
		CLASS="bodylink">Data Retriever</A>,
		<A HREF="../pm/db_die_f.htm" TARGET="display" TITLE="Filer"
		CLASS="bodylink">Filer</A>, and
		<A HREF="../pm/db_die_w.htm" TARGET="display" TITLE="Word Processing Filer"
		CLASS="bodylink">Word Processing Filer</A> in the "<A HREF="../pm/dba_frm.htm"
		TARGET="_top">Database Server (DBS) API</A>" chapter of the "<A
		HREF="../pm/index.htm" TARGET="_top"
		TITLE="VA FileMan V. 22.0 Programmer HTML Manual" CLASS="bodylink">VA FileMan
		Programmer Manual</A>."</P> 
	 <P>This task of returning the data to the WORD-PROCESSING-type field can
		also be accomplished by code in the RETURN TO CALLING EDITOR field (see below).
		</P> 
	 <P>If the editor uses any local M variables beginning with "<B>D</B>", they
		should be NEWed to avoid problems upon return to VA FileMan. Also, avoid calls
		to VA FileMan utilities in the fields that accept M code so that variables upon
		which VA FileMan depends -- like <B>DA</B> and <B>D0</B> -- are not changed.
		</P> 
	 <P>The OK TO RUN TEST field contains code that checks to determine whether
		it is OK to run the editor:</P> 
	 <PRE>
    OK TO RUN TEST: <B>I ^%ZOSF("OS")["VAX"&amp;(DUZ(0)["@")
</B>
</PRE> 
	 <P>This field is optional; if nothing is entered, there are no restrictions
		on the use of the editor. The code should set <B>$T</B> to true if it is OK to
		proceed or to false if it is not. If the code returns <B>$T=false</B>, the user
		will automatically return to the Line Editor. In this example, the environment
		is being checked to ensure that the called editor is available and it is
		verified that the user has the required VA FileMan Access Code. </P> 
	 <P>M code entered into the optional RETURN TO CALLING EDITOR field can be
		used to restore the environment needed by the Line Editor:</P> 
	 <PRE>
    RETURN TO CALLING EDITOR: <B></B>
</PRE> 
	 <P>Since the user can switch editors at will, it is safest to restore the
		text to its previous location in the global and to maintain the local symbol
		table, as mentioned above. If these tasks are accomplished by code in the
		ACTIVATION CODE FROM DIWE field or by the called routine, this field is
		unnecessary. </P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> The edited text <I>must</I> be restored; VA FileMan will
		<I>not</I> move text back to the proper global location. </P> 
	  
	 <PRE>DESCRIPTION:
      1&gt;The VMS editor.
      2&gt; <B></B>
    EDIT Option: <B></B>
    Select ALTERNATE EDITOR: 
</PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>The definition of the Alternate Editor is complete. An editor's
		developer should provide information needed to set up an ALTERNATE EDITOR file
		entry. The local site manager has flexibility in setting up the editor. In
		particular, the OK TO RUN TEST field can be used to enforce local policies
		regarding access to editors. </P>
