	 <H4>Transferring Entries Between Files</H4> 
	 <P>You can use the Transfer Entries option to move <I>all</I> or a
		<I>group</I> of entries from one file to an entirely separate file. To do
		this:</P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>Answer the "INPUT TO WHAT FILE:" prompt and the "TRANSFER FROM FILE:"
		  prompt with different file names. <BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Specify whether transferred entries should be added all as new, or
		  whether they should be merged with existing entries.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Specify whether transferred entries should be deleted in the original
		  file.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Specify which entries to transfer, by entering a sort criteria.</LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P>For transfer to occur, the NAME fields (#.01) of both files must have
		matching LABELs and DATA TYPEs. In this way VA FileMan can identify
		corresponding entries. Values of the fields can then be transferred. Only those
		fields where the field LABEL and DATA TYPE match will be transferred. Before
		the transfer is done, you are told which fields will have their data
		transferred. </P> 
	 <P>The dialogue presented when transferring entries to another file is
		presented below. In this instance, you are transferring the contents of the
		SCHOLAR file to the NEW SCHOLAR file. The NEW SCHOLAR file already exists, and
		it does have some entries whose NAME field matches those in the SCHOLAR file.
		</P> 
	  
	 <PRE>Select OPTION: <B>TRANSFER ENTRIES</B>   

Select TRANSFER OPTION: <B>TRANSFER FILE ENTRIES</B>   
 
INPUT TO WHAT FILE: <B>NEW SCHOLAR</B>
TRANSFER FROM FILE: NEW SCHOLAR// <B>SCHOLAR</B>
'NAME' FIELDS, 'SSN' FIELDS, 'DATE OF BIRTH' FIELDS, 'SUBJECT AREA' 
FIELDS,'TOPICS' FIELDS, WILL BE TRANSFERRED 
 
WANT TO MERGE TRANSFERRED ENTRIES WITH ONES ALREADY THERE? NO// <B>YES</B> 
WANT EACH ENTRY TO BE DELETED AS IT'S TRANSFERRED? <B>NO</B>
TRANSFER ENTRIES BY: NAME// <B></B>
START WITH NAME: FIRST// <B></B>
DEVICE: HOME// <B></B></PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>You can specify whether you want entries with the same NAME field to be
		merged when the transfers are made, or whether each transferred entry and
		subentry should become a distinct new entry in the target file. (In this case,
		the answer was YES to merge.) You can also specify whether or not the entries
		should be deleted from the "from" file as they are transferred. (In this case,
		the answer was NO to delete.) </P> 
	 <P>A simple report is created that lists the entries that were transferred.
		You have the ability to route that list to a printer using the "DEVICE:"
		prompt. </P> 
	 <P>In addition, you have considerable control over which entries are
		transferred. Your answers to the "TRANSFER ENTRIES BY:" and "START WITH:"
		prompts select entries in the same way that you specify sort criteria when
		describing a print output. (See the "<A HREF="../u1/pr_frm.htm" TARGET="_top"
		TITLE="Print: How to Print Reports from Files" CLASS="bodylink">Print: How to
		Print Reports from Files</A>" chapter of the "<A HREF="../u1/index.htm"
		TARGET="_top" TITLE="VA FileMan V. 22.0 Getting Started HTML Manual"
		CLASS="bodylink">VA FileMan Getting Started Manual</A>.") </P> 
	 <P>For example, if you only wanted to transfer scholars born after 1900 to
		the NEW SCHOLAR file, you could answer the "TRANSFER ENTRIES BY:" prompt like
		this: </P> 
	 <PRE>    TRANSFER ENTRIES BY: NAME// <B>DATE OF BIRTH&gt;1900</B>
    WITHIN DATE OF BIRTH&gt;1900, TRANSFER ENTRIES BY: <B></B></PRE> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> The Transfer Entries option can be used to purge files. You
		can define a SCHOLAR ARCHIVE file containing a subset of the fields that are in
		the original file (perhaps the fields: NAME, SSN, and DATE OF BIRTH); you can
		then simply transfer into this separate file all or a selected group of entries
		from the original file, deleting the entries as they are transferred. </P>
