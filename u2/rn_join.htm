	 <H4>Join Extended Pointer</H4> 
	 <P>You can establish an extended pointer link even if there is no
		pre-existing pointer relationship between the two files. You use a value from
		one file to do a lookup in a second file. </P> 
	 <P>Suppose you store in the PAY FACTOR file a list of factors for
		calculating taxes. Each entry in this file corresponds to a different pay
		scale. In the PERSONNEL file, you have a field called PAYSCALE. You want to
		retrieve the value of a field DEDUCTION in the PAY FACTOR entry that equals the
		PAYSCALE field for each entry in the PERSONNEL file. You can create a COMPUTED
		field expression in the PERSONNEL file: </P> 
	 <PRE>    'COMPUTED-FIELD' EXPRESSION: <B>PAYSCALE IN PAY FACTOR FILE:DEDUCTION</B></PRE> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> PAYSCALE was not defined as pointing to the PAY FACTOR
		file. The link to that file is made by the COMPUTED field definition. PAYSCALE
		could itself be a COMPUTED field. In this situation, the value of the PAYSCALE
		field in the PERSONNEL file is used to do a normal lookup in the PAY FACTOR
		file using all lookup type cross-references. </P> 
	 <P>In database terminology, this extended pointer capability is similar to
		a <B>JOIN</B> operation because you can specify at any time a new relationship
		between two formerly unrelated files. Therefore, we call this type of pointing
		the Join Extended Pointer. </P> 
	 <H5>Limitations</H5> 
	 <P>If the join expression matches more than one entry in the file being
		joined, the first matching entry (by internal entry number) is returned as the
		result of the join. Thus, if your join expression is likely to match more than
		one entry, be aware that only the <I>first</I> matching entry is returned.</P> 
	 <H5>Example</H5> 
	 <P>You could find out if any entries in the PERSONNEL file could be matched
		against the NAME field in the PATIENT file just by specifying the following
		sort: </P> 
	  
	 <PRE>OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: <B>PATIENT</B>

SORT BY: <B>NAME IN PERSONNEL FILE</B></PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>The expression at the "SORT BY:" prompt selects entries in the PERSONNEL
		file where the value of the NAME field in the PATIENT file matches the
		PERSONNEL file's .01 field. The PATIENT file's NAME field is being used as a
		lookup in the PERSONNEL file. Since we are evaluating the .01 field of the
		PERSONNEL file, the "<B>:element</B>" part of the extended pointer syntax is
		unnecessary. </P>
