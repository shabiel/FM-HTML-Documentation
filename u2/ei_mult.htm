	 <H4>Special Considerations: Multiples</H4> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Exporting">Exporting Data From Multiples</A></H5> 
	 <P><B>Data Flattening</B></P> 
	 <P>Data exported from Multiples is "flattened;" that is, data at upper
		levels is repeated for each subentry. For example, take the comma-delimited
		export for a top level file's #.01 NAME field and a Subfile's #.01 DATE and #1
		TYPE fields. The output for an entry with four subentries would look like:</P> 
	  
	 <PRE>SMITH,01-JAN-95,SC
    SMITH,24-JUN-95,NSC
    SMITH,14-AUG-95,SC
    SMITH,21-JUL-96,NSC</PRE> <HR> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> The top level .01 field is repeated for each Subfile
		entry.</P> 
	 <P><B>No More Than One Multiple at Any One File Level</B></P> 
	 <P>You can't export <I>more than one</I> Multiple at <I>any one file
		level</I>. You can export data from one Multiple and from Subfiles directly
		descendent from that Multiple (as long as you never export more than one
		Subfile at the same level). Suppose you're exporting data from a file with the
		following structure: </P> 
	 <P></P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="EI_mult.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="305"
		HEIGHT="240" ALT="Example Showing Various Multiple Levels."> </P> 
	 <P>In addition to fields in the Primary file, you can export from Subfile
		1A <I>or</I> Subfile 2A, but not from both. Also, you can export from Subfile
		2A, Subfile 2B-1, and Subfile 2C-1, but you could not additionally choose
		fields in Subfile 2B-2. If you need data from Subfiles that are not directly
		descendent from each other, you can do multiple exports and "join" the data
		together in the importing application. </P> 
	 <P><B>Sorting with Multiples</B></P> 
	 <P>A special, automated sort is done to the data when Multiples are
		exported; you <I>cannot</I> perform your own sort. When Subfiles are involved,
		the Export Tool performs a special sort in order to format the data. Since the
		Export Tool must do this customized sort, you cannot sort the data yourself. If
		you need the data in a particular sequence, sort it in the importing
		application. You can perform any search on the data that is necessary to choose
		entries for export. </P> <HR> 
	 <H5><A NAME="Importing">Importing Data Into Multiples</A></H5> 
	 <P><B>Incoming Data Should Not be Flattened</B></P> 
	 <P>The Import Tool expects that any data bound for a Multiple be contained
		in the same import record (line of data) as the data for the top file level.
		This is different from the output of the Export Tool, which "flattens" exported
		data from Multiples into separate lines of output. </P> 
	 <P>For example, consider a comma-delimited import of records, each
		including a name plus four subentries. Each subentry contains a DATE and a
		TYPE. The records will be imported into a file with a top-level #.01 NAME
		field, and a Multiple with #.01 DATE and #1 TYPE fields. For this import, you
		would choose the destination fields as follows:</P> 
	 <P></P> 
	 <CENTER>
		<IMG SRC="ei_mult2.gif" WIDTH="558" HEIGHT="350"
		 ALT="Example of the Field Selection for Import Form."> </CENTER> 
	 <P></P> 
	 <P>A corresponding line of data to be imported for a record, containing
		data for both the top-level record and its subentries, would look like:</P> 
	 <PRE>    SMITH,01-JAN-95,SC,24-JUN-95,NSC,14-AUG-95,SC,21-JUL-96,NSC</PRE> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> You must file the same number of subentries in each record
		you import.</P> 
	 <P><B>Completeness of Subfile Entries</B></P> 
	 <P>New subentries need to be added to every Subfile on a path to the lowest
		level Subfiles. Your data must include values for the .01 field and all the
		required identifiers for every Subfile (as well as for the top level of the
		file). You can add more than one subentry in a particular Subfile. However, you
		are restricted to the same set of fields for every entry in each Subfile.</P>
