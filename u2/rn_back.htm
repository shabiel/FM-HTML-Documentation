		CLASS="bodylink">Simple extended pointers</A> let you retrieve information from
		an entry in another file that the current entry explicitly points to through a
		POINTER TO A FILE field. What if you wanted to go the other way -- retrieve
		information from an entry in another file that points to (<I>not</I> from) the
		current entry? </P>

		<IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="rn_back.gif" WIDTH="625" HEIGHT="379"
		 ALT="Example of Simple Extended Pointers."> </CENTER> 
	 <P></P> 
	 <P>Suppose you've selected the PATIENT file and you want to list dates of
		radiology exams for certain patients. If the pointer is from the RADIOLOGY EXAM
		file to the PATIENT file (<I>not</I> the other way around), you can list the
		radiology exam dates using a <I>Backward Extended Pointer</I>. </P> 
	 <P>In the file that contains the POINTER TO A FILE field, one of the
		following three conditions must be true:</P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>Either a New-Style or Traditional cross-reference on the field
		  exists. If the POINTER TO A FILE field is in a subfile Multiple, the whole file
		  must be cross-referenced. Compound cross-references may be used as long as the
		  first subscript in the cross-reference is the pointer value with no transforms.
		  The use of a compound cross-reference may result in "navigation" to only a
		  subset of the pointing entries. Even though a record may have a valid POINTER
		  TO A FILE field, unless all the other fields that make up subscripts on the
		  compound index are also non-null, there won't be an entry in the index for that
		  record.<BR> <BR></LI> 
		<LI>The .001 field of the file is the pointing field.<BR> <BR></LI> 
		<LI>The .01 field of the pointing file is the pointing field, and there
		  is a "DINUM" condition on the field. </LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P>To use a Backward Extended Pointer, you must make a
		<A HREF="rn_jump.htm" TITLE="relational jump" CLASS="bodylink">relational
		jump</A> from the current file to the file in question (enter the name of the
		file pointing to the current file, followed by a colon). Once you make the
		relational jump to the backwards-pointer-linked file, specify which
		fields/elements to access in that file. </P> 
	 <P>Returning to the situation mentioned above, within the RADIOLOGY EXAM
		file there is a field called EXAMINEE pointing back to our PATIENT file. That
		EXAMINEE pointer field is cross-referenced. You want to list the EXAM DATE
		field from the RADIOLOGY EXAM file entries that point back to a patient. From
		the PATIENT file, enter: </P> 
	  
	 <PRE>FIRST PRINT FIELD:  <B>NAME;N;S1</B>
THEN PRINT FIELD:  <B>RADIOLOGY EXAM: </B>     <B>&lt;-- <I>Relational Jump!</I></B>
   By 'RADIOLOGY EXAM', do you mean the RADIOLOGY EXAM File,
       pointing via its 'EXAMINEE' Field? YES// <B></B>  (YES)
  THEN PRINT RADIOLOGY EXAM FIELD: <B>EXAM DATE</B> 
  THEN PRINT RADIOLOGY EXAM FIELD: <B></B>
THEN PRINT FIELD: <B></B></PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>As indicated by this example, you did not have to specify the EXAMINEE
		field. That field was identified because it is a field in the RADIOLOGY EXAM
		file that points back to the current file. Following is the output produced by
		these print specifications: </P>

	 <P>The resulting output is a two-column report containing names from the
		PATIENT file and corresponding examination dates from the RADIOLOGY EXAM file.
		Since there may be several RADIOLOGY EXAM file entries for a given patient,
		this report is an example of a Multiple-valued (Multiline) result being
		returned.</P>
