	 <H4>Transferring File Entries Introduction</H4> 
	 <P>The Transfer Entries submenu contains two options (Transfer File Entries
		and Compare/Merge File Entries) to allow you to compare and/or merge two
		entries in a single file or to transfer entries from one file to another. For
		example, you may need to combine data from two different entries into one of
		the two. This could happen in a patient database when the same patient has been
		inadvertently entered twice with the name spelled slightly differently. </P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> Once you have merged file entries, the merging cannot be
		undone. Care must be taken that data is not mistakenly lost. </P> 
	 <H5>Transfer File Entries Option</H5> 
	 <P>The Transfer File Entries option can be used for several purposes. You
		can use it to:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><A HREF="te_same.htm" TITLE="Merge two entries in the same file"
		  CLASS="bodylink">Merge two entries in the same file</A><BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><A HREF="te_diff.htm"
		  TITLE="Transfer one or more records from one file to another file"
		  CLASS="bodylink">Transfer one or more records from one file to another
		  file</A><BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><A HREF="te_new.htm" TITLE="Copy a data dictionary into a new file"
		  CLASS="bodylink">Copy a data dictionary into a new file</A></LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>However, the Compare/Merge File Entries option (described below) should
		usually be used to merge entries in the same file; it is specifically designed
		for that task. </P> 
	 <P>You must have READ access for the file you are transferring from and
		WRITE access for the file you are transferring to. If you are deleting entries
		after the transfer, you need delete access as well. (See the "<A
		HREF="ds_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" TITLE="Data Security" CLASS="bodylink">Data
		Security</A>" chapter for the details of file security.) </P> 
	 <H5>Compare/Merge File Entries Option</H5> 
	 <P>The Compare/Merge File Entries option allows you to
		<A HREF="te_comp.htm" TITLE="compare" CLASS="bodylink">compare</A> the data
		value of two entries before
		<A HREF="te_merge.htm" TITLE="merging them" CLASS="bodylink">merging them</A>
		into one entry. Furthermore, this option provides you with an opportunity to
		identify the data values from either entry that will be used to create the
		final merged entry. Both of the entries involved must be in the same file to
		use this option. </P>
