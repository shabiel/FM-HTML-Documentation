	 <H4>Map Pointer Relations Option</H4> 
	 <P>The Map Pointer Relations option on the Data Dictionary Utilities
		submenu creates a graphic representation of the pointer relationships between
		files. (Files are linked by POINTER TO A FILE and VARIABLE-POINTER field types.
		</P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> These field types are described in the "<A
		HREF="cr_flds.htm" TITLE="Creating Fields" CLASS="bodylink">Creating
		Fields</A>" topic in the "<A HREF="cr_frm.htm" TARGET="_top"
		TITLE="Creating Files and Fields" CLASS="bodylink">Creating Files and
		Fields</A>" chapter in this manual.) </P> 
	 <P>You select an application package, a file, or a group of files to be
		mapped. If you select a package to map, you are given the opportunity to
		exclude a file or files from the map. The initial dialogue goes like this: </P>
	 
	  
	 <PRE>Select DATA DICTIONARY UTILITY OPTION: <B>MAP POINTER RELATIONS</B>

Prints a graph of pointer relations in a database of FileMan files
named in the Kernel PACKAGE file (9.4) or given separately.
Works best with 132 column output!

Select PACKAGE NAME: <B></B>

Enter files to be included 
Add FILE: <B>PATIENT</B>   
Add FILE: <B></B>

Files included                  16026  PATIENT 

Enter name of file group for optional graph header: <B>PATIENT FILE</B>

DEVICE: HOME// <B></B></PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>In this instance, only a single file, the PATIENT file, has been
		selected for mapping. Of course, a more useful and complex map would be
		produced if an entire package or a large, related group of files were mapped.
		</P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> You must have DD access to the PACKAGE file (#9.4) and to
		the files chosen at the "Add FILE:" prompt. </P> 
	 <P>The output consists of three columns. The middle column has the target
		file or files, each surrounded by a box. This is the file or group of files
		that you asked to be mapped. To the left, in the first column, are the files
		and fields that point to the target file. An abbreviated description of the
		field is shown. To the right, in the last column, are any files that are
		pointed to by the target file. The output's heading contains brief descriptions
		of the codes used. </P> 
	 <P>A possible output for the PATIENT file is shown below: </P>

	 <P>This output shows that the CLIENT field in the ADMISSIONS file points to
		the PATIENT file. LAYGO additions are allowed and the ADMISSIONS file is not in
		the set of files being mapped. Further, the RELIGION field in the PATIENT file
		points to the RELIGION file and the PROVIDER field, a "<B>v</B>"
		(VARIABLE-POINTER), points to the PERSON and PROVIDER files. If the target file
		points to a file that is not in the account, the map shows:</P> 
	 <PRE>    *** NONEXISTENT FILE ***</PRE> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> The "Pointer Map" section of the "VA FileMan Technical
		Manual" has a more elaborate example of a pointer map.</P>
