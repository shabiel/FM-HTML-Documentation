	 <P>There are seven types of Traditional cross-references and two types of
		New-Style cross-references available. Generally, a cross-reference in VA
		FileMan specifies that some action is performed when the field's value is
		entered, changed, or deleted. For several types of cross-references, the action
		consists of putting the value into a list -- an index used when looking up an
		entry or when sorting. The regular cross-reference is used for sorting and for
		lookup; you can limit it to sorting only. The KWIC, mnemonic, and SOUNDEX
		cross-references are also used for lookup. </P> 
	 <P>You can sort a file on any field (except a WORD-PROCESSING-type field)
		whether or not a cross-reference exists for the field. However, sorting is done
		more quickly and efficiently if a regular cross-reference exists on the field.
		</P> 
	 <P>When a file is created, a Traditional cross-reference on the NAME (#.01)
		field is automatically established. You can add or delete cross-references at
		any time using the Cross-Reference a Field or File option of the Utility
		Functions submenu. This option can also be used to enter a description of a
		cross-reference and to prevent the cross-reference from being deleted. </P> 
	 <P>You can create a cross-reference on a Multiple field, a Multiple's
		subfields, or on any other field type except a WORD-PROCESSING-type field. For
		example, the PATIENT file contains the AGE AT ONSET subfield in the DIAGNOSIS
		Multiple. If you create a regular cross-reference for a field in a Multiple,
		you can choose in what context the cross-reference will be used. You might want
		to cross-reference the whole file by AGE AT ONSET (so that a report sorted by
		AGE AT ONSET could be produced efficiently). Alternately, you might want to
		cross-reference only an individual patient's diagnoses by onset age (so that a
		lookup of diagnosis could be done using AGE AT ONSET). </P> <HR>

		SRC="new.gif" ALT="New/Updated with VA FileMan V. 22.0 with FM V. 22"
		WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="11"></H5> 
	 <P>Two types of New-Style cross-references are available: Regular and
		MUMPS. They are like their Traditional cross-reference counterparts, but
		New-Style cross-references offer some unique advantages:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><B>Compound Cross-references --</B>You can create not only
		  <B><I>simple cross-references</I></B> that are based on a single field, but
		  <B><I>compound cross-references</I></B>, cross-references that are based on
		  more than one field in a file. For example, in a regular New-Style "C" index
		  you can store both the Name and ID Number of a record as subscripts in a single
		  index: 
		  <PRE>^DIZ(1000,"C","DOE,JANE","A56789",14) =
^DIZ(1000,"C","SMITH,JOHN","D1234",5) =
</PRE> In order to create this kind of index with a Traditional
		  cross-reference, you would have to create two MUMPS-type cross-references, one
		  on the NAME field and one on the ID Number field. New-Style cross-references
		  allow you to define this compound cross-reference once as a regular index that
		  VA FileMan can use for lookup and sorting. <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Field- or Record-Level Execution --</B>Since a Traditional
		  cross-reference is defined on a particular field, the action associated with
		  that cross-reference is performed whenever the field is edited. With New-Style
		  cross-references, you can specify that the action associated with a
		  cross-reference be performed only once after the entire record has been edited,
		  typically at the end of the editing session. Record-level execution would
		  normally be selected for compound cross-references. <BR> <BR> If the "C" index
		  in the example above were defined using Traditional MUMPS-type
		  cross-references, and both the NAME and ID Number fields were contained in a
		  single INPUT template, the index would be updated when the NAME field was
		  edited, and then again when the ID Number was edited. But if the
		  cross-reference were defined as a New-Style compound index with record-level
		  execution, the index would be updated only once after the entire record was
		  edited, after changes to both the NAME and ID Number fields had been completed.
		  <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Code to Kill the Entire Index --</B>This is code that VA FileMan
		  can execute to remove an entire index from a file. This can make re-indexing a
		  file much more efficient. To delete an index, VA FileMan can execute the
		  <I>Kill Entire Index Code</I>, instead of looping through all the record in a
		  file and removing each record's index one at a time. <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Activity --</B>New-Style cross-references can have an Activity of
		  "<B>R</B>" and/or "<B>I</B>" to allow you to control whether the
		  cross-reference should be fired during <B>R</B>eindexing and/or
		  <B>I</B>nstallation (KIDS). If you call IX^DIK, IX1^DIK, or IXALL^DIK or if you
		  select the Re-Index File option on VA FileMan's Utility Functions submenu to
		  re-index all cross-references, only those New-Style cross-references that
		  contain an "<B>R</B>" in Activity will be fired. <BR> <BR> If you explicitly
		  select a cross-reference in an EN^DIK, EN1^DIK, or ENALL^DIK call or in the
		  Re-Index File option on VA FileMan's Utility Functions submenu, that
		  cross-reference is fired regardless of its Activity. Also, when a field is
		  edited, VA FileMan ignores Activity and fires all cross-references on that
		  field, though you can control whether a cross-reference is fired by entering
		  SET and KILL Conditions. <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Collation --</B>You can specify forwards or backwards collation,
		  the direction in which VA FileMan's lookup utilities loop through a subscript
		  in an index when entries are returned or displayed to the user. This is
		  especially useful for dates. Developers can store dates in their natural
		  internal VA FileMan date format, and still display entries in the date index in
		  reverse date order. <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Lookup Prompt --</B>Each subscript on an index in the new INDEX
		  file can be assigned a LOOKUP PROMPT. This prompt will be used as the prompt
		  for entry of the lookup value during classic VA FileMan lookup ^DIC calls. If
		  not filled in, VA FileMan will default to use the name of the field for that
		  subscript value, if there is one. <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Computed Values --</B>Those with programmer access can have any
		  value in the cross-reference be computed; that is, the value is determined from
		  M code that sets the variable X. <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Subscript Transforms --</B>Those with programmer access can define
		  a <I>Transform for Storage</I> and a <I>Transform for Display</I> on subscripts
		  in an index. The <I>Transform for Storage</I> is code that transforms the
		  internal value of a field before it is stored as a subscript in the index. The
		  <I>Transform for Display</I> is code that transforms the value stored in the
		  index back to a form that can be displayed to the user. <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>SET and KILL Conditions --</B>Those with programmer access can
		  enter M code that specifies whether the SET or KILL logic is fired. The M code
		  sets the variable X to Boolean true only if the logic should be executed. The
		  "before" and "after" values are available in the X, X1, and X2 arrays (see the
		  <A HREF="#array_table"
			TITLE="Set and Kill Logic/Condition for X, X1, and X2 Arrays Table (array, value in KILL, value in SET)"
			CLASS="bodylink">table</A> below). <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>The X, X1, and X2 Arrays --</B>Those with programmer access can
		  reference the X, X1, and X2 arrays in the SET and KILL logic and the SET and
		  KILL conditions of New-Style cross-references. When a field is edited and the
		  cross-reference logic is executed, the field's corresponding X1 array element
		  contains the old value of the field, the X2 array element contains the new
		  value of the field, and the X array element contains either the old or new
		  value, depending on whether the SET logic, SET condition, KILL logic, or KILL
		  condition is being executed: <BR><BR>
