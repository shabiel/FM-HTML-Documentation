	 <H4>Merging Entries</H4> 
	 <P>You can use the Compare/Merge File Entries option to merge entries. To
		do this:</P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>Identify a file.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Identify the two entries to be compared.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Answer YES to the "MERGE THESE ENTRIES AFTER COMPARING THEM?"
		  prompt.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Choose which entry will supply the default values.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Choose to retain or delete the "merge from" record.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Optionally adjust, field-by-field, which entry supplies the default
		  value.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Choose to proceed with the merge, summarize before merging, or
		  re-edit the merge criteria.</LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P>This process is described in detail via an example below: </P> 
	  
	 <PRE>MERGE THESE ENTRIES AFTER COMPARING THEM? NO// <B>YES</B>
    1 RUSSELL,BERTRAND A.
    2 RUSSELL,BERTRAND W.</PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>After choosing a file and two entries to compare, enter YES at the
		"MERGE THESE ENTRIES AFTER COMPARING THEM? NO//" prompt to merge the entries as
		well as compare them.</P> 
	 <P>You now specify which of the two entries will be used to supply the
		default values. The entry you choose will be the "merge to" entry that will
		contain the merged data.</P> 
	  
	 <PRE>NOTE: Records will be merged into the entry selected for the default.
WHICH ENTRY SHOULD BE USED FOR DEFAULT VALUES (1 OR 2)? <B>1</B>
 *** Records will be merged into RUSSELL,BERTRAND A. </PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>You next indicate the disposition of the "merge from" entry. You can
		choose to delete it or retain it unmodified. You can also redirect pointers
		that point to the "merged from" entry to point to the "merge to" entry. Free
		text pointers will <I>not</I> be redirected.</P> 
	  
	 <PRE>DO YOU WANT TO DELETE THE MERGED FROM ENTRY AFTER MERGING ? <B>YES</B>
DO YOU WANT TO REPOINT ENTRIES POINTING TO THIS ENTRY? <B>YES</B>
ENTER FILE TO EXCLUDE FROM REPOINT/MERGE: <B></B></PRE> <HR> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> You can also choose to exclude pointers from specified
		files in the repointing process. In this example, all pointers will be
		repointed. </P> 
	  
	 <PRE>DO YOU WANT TO DISPLAY ONLY THE DISCREPANT FIELDS?  NO// <B></B>
DEVICE: <B></B>  </PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>Press the Enter/Return key at the "DEVICE:" prompt so that you can
		continue to control how the merge is to proceed. Since the merge is
		interactive, it is not appropriate to release control to a printer or other
		output device. While working at a keyboard printer is possible, it is not
		recommended, because you will not be able to monitor the selection of data
		values that is described below. </P> 
	 <P>VA FileMan will display the data from the entries being merged. Brackets
		indicate the values that will be used to create the final merged entry. If the
		data values in both entries are the same, no brackets are shown. To start, the
		values for Russell,Bertrand A. are bracketed because that entry was chosen as
		the default entry. To switch the value that will go into the merged entry,
		enter that field's number. The following example shows the initial defaults in
		brackets and the response to switching the value for the SSN field: </P>

Enter 1-4 to change a default value, ^ to exit report, RETURN to continue: <B></B></PRE> <HR> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> The DATE OF BIRTH field from Russell,Bertrand W. is
		bracketed because the default entry has no value for that field; it is null.
		When the default ("merged to") entry has no data in a field, data will always
		be brought over from the "merged from" entry. You have no control over this
		aspect of the merging. Even if you attempt to switch the data value to the null
		value and remove the brackets, the data will still be brought into the "merged
		to" field. </P> 
	 <P>If there is more than one screen of field information, VA FileMan will
		display additional screens. In this case, there is one field that is a
		Multiple. The Compare/Merge File Entries option neither displays data from
		WORD-PROCESSING or Multiple fields nor allows the selection of data for the
		final "merge to" entry. The number of subentries in the Multiples of the two
		fields is displayed: </P>

Enter RETURN to continue: <B></B></PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>The merging of data for a WORD-PROCESSING field or for a Multiple and
		its subfields is done in the same way that the Transfer File Entries option
		does it.</P> 
	 <P>Although VA FileMan is ready to perform the merge at this time, you are
		prompted with other options -- just in case you are not ready. In order to
		cancel the merge, enter the up-arrow ("<B>^</B>") at the "ACTION:" prompt to
		exit.</P> 
	  
	 <PRE>OK.  I'M READY TO DO THE MERGE. 
 
       Select one of the following:

 ACTION: </PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>These three options are described below.</P> 
	 <H5>PROCEED</H5> 
	 <P>If you enter P or PROCEED at the "ACTION:" prompt, then VA FileMan will

	 <PRE>ACTION: <B>P</B>ROCEED to merge the data. 
 
 I will now merge all subfiles in this file ...
