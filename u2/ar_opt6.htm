	 <H4>Move Archived Data to Permanent Storage</H4> 
	 <P>Once you have written an archiving activity to temporary storage, you
		can use the Move Archived Data to Permanent Storage option. If you choose an
		archiving activity that has not yet been written to temporary storage, a
		warning is issued. </P> 
	 <P>This option will do several things not necessarily in the order listed
		here. </P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>It will print an Archive Activity report which prints information
		  from the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY file (#1.11), such as the archiver (i.e., the person
		  who selected this option), the archival activity number, an index of all
		  archived entries, and the search criteria used during the Select Entries to
		  Archive process, etc.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>It will build an index of all archived entries and write this index
		  at the beginning of the archived file. An item in the index contains the .01
		  value of the entry, along with all PRIMARY KEY and Identifier values for that
		  entry. <BR> <BR> <B>NOTE:</B> The PRIMARY KEY is new with Version
		  22.0&nbsp;<IMG SRC="new.gif" ALT="New/Updated with VA FileMan V. 22.0"
		  WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="11"><BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>It will prompt for Archive Device Label information. This information
		  will usually represent some naming convention that Systems Managers use as
		  physical label for devices such as tape. If using a disk file, the full disk
		  file name will be presented as a default. This device label information along
		  with the index printed on the Archive Activity report should be useful in
		  locating an archived entry and the device to which it was
		  archived.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Lastly, this option will move archive data to permanent storage.
		  Permanent storage is considered any sequential storage media like SDP, VMS
		  file, magnetic tape, or disk data set.</LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P>You can send to more than one permanent storage location without having
		to recreate the archiving activity. When the archived data is moved to
		permanent storage, every line contained in the temporary storage word
		processing field is simply read and then written to a sequential medium. </P> 
	 <P>The status of your archiving activity after using this option is
		ARCHIVED (PERMANENT). </P> 
	 <P>In the example below, the archiving activity is identified by file name,
		"CHANGE." It is going to be archived to the specified tape:</P> 
	  
	 <PRE>Select ARCHIVE OPTION: <B>MOVE</B> ARCHIVED DATA TO PERMANENT STORAGE
Select ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY: <B>CHANGE </B>       3 CHANGE  08-30-92     
ARCHIVED(TEMPORARY)     SELECTOR:SMITH,J     ARCHIVING

NOTE:  This option will 1) print an archive activity report to 
specified PRINTER DEVICE and 2) will move archive data to permanent 
storage to specified ARCHIVE STORAGE DEVICE.

Select some type of SEQUENTIAL storage media, such as SDP, TAPE, or 
DISK FILE (HFS) for archival storage.

PRINTER DEVICE: <B>PRINTER</B>

ARCHIVE STORAGE DEVICE: <B>MAGTAPE Parameter (&quot;CAVL&quot;:0:2048)</B>
DO YOU WANT YOUR OUTPUT QUEUED?  NO// <B>YES</B>
Requested Start Time:  NOW// <B></B>

ARCHIVE DEVICE LABEL:  ISC6V3$MUA0:ARCHIVE;083092;3// <B></B></PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>If the archive storage device is tape, an archive device label is
		generated for you, as depicted in the previous example. You can override this
		label by entering your own device label information. </P> 
	 <P>If you select an archive storage device that is non-sequential, a
		warning is issued. You are given the option to continue the archiving process.
		</P> 
	 <P><B>CAUTION:</B> If you specify a device that can be overwritten (e.g.,
		SDP) or that does <I>not</I> electronically store data (e.g., a printer), the
		data will be <I>forever</I> irretrievable.</P> 
	 <P>Depending on what devices are selected, and whether queueing was
		requested for either device, different warnings will be issued informing the
		user of either steps he need to take or steps that the program will take as a
		result of the queueing request. </P>
