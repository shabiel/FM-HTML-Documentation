	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> These examples assume that the user does <i>not</i> have
		programmer access. For explanations of additional capabilities available to the
		programmer, please refer to the "<a href="../pm/afd_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Advanced File Definition" class="bodylink">Advanced File Definition</a>"

		Programmer Manual</a>."</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="File">File Creation</a></h5> 
	 <p>The following example illustrates the file definition dialogue you see
		when creating a new file using the Modify File Attributes option. In this case,
		we will create the ORDER file (#100, a standard VA FileMan file):</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select OPTION: <b>MOD</b>IFY FILE ATTRIBUTES  <br>DO YOU WANT TO USE THE SCREEN-MODE VERSION? Yes// <b></b>  (Yes)<br> <br>MODIFY WHAT FILE: <b>ORDER</b> <br>  Are you adding 'ORDER' as a new FILE?  No// <b>Y </b>  (Yes) <br>   FILE NUMBER:  99000// <b>100</b>

...SORRY, HOLD ON...
     A FreeText NAME Field (#.01) has been created.
 

Select FIELD: <b>NAME</b></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>VA FileMan prompts you to enter the file name. If it is a new file, VA
		FileMan will ask you to confirm that you want to add a new file. The default
		file number to the left of the "<b>//</b>" (e.g., 99000) is related to a site
		number that is assigned to your computer when VA FileMan is initialized. This
		file number is within the range of numbers assigned to your site. Be sure to
		follow local policies when assigning file numbers.</p> 
	 <p>As you can see from this example, when a file is created a field with
		the label NAME and number .01 is automatically created. When creating a new
		file, you can change the definition of this field in the same way you can
		change the definition of any other field.</p> 
	 <p>When you select a field (e.g., the NAME field), you will then be taken
		into a ScreenMan form where you can edit the properties of the field, as shown
		below:</p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <center>
		<img src="CR_1.gif" alt="Example of Editing the .01 Field in Screen Mode." height="317" width="615"> </center> 
	  
	 <h5><a name="Date/Time">DATE/TIME Field</a></h5> 
	 <p>In the following example, the DATA TYPE field for the RELEASE DATE/TIME
		field (#.68) in the ORDER file (#100) has a value of DATE/TIME:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select OPTION: <b>MOD</b>IFY FILE ATTRIBUTES  <br>DO YOU WANT TO USE THE SCREEN-MODE VERSION? Yes// <b></b>  (Yes)<br> <br>MODIFY WHAT FILE: ORDER// <b></b>
 

Select FIELD: <b>RELEASE DATE/TIME</b></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>You will then be taken into a ScreenMan form where you can edit the
		properties of the field, as shown below:</p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <center>
		<img src="Datefld.jpg" alt="Example of a DATE/TIME DATA TYPE in Screen Mode." height="455" width="640"> </center> 
	  
	 <p>In Screen Mode, whenever the DATA TYPE field is editable, a "pop-up"
		window appears, containing editable attributes of the field that are pertinent
		to its specific Data Type. DATE/TIME-type fields don't have any required
		entries. You can accept all the default values within the "pop-up" window,
		simply by closing the window by pressing the "F1-C" keys.</p> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> To delete the entire field, enter an at-sign ("<b>@</b>")
		at the "FIELD LABEL:" prompt.</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="Set">SET OF CODES Field</a></h5> 
	 <p>In the following example, the DATA TYPE field for the FLAGGED field
		(#.61) in the ORDER file (#100) has a value of SET OF CODES:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select OPTION: <b>MOD</b>IFY FILE ATTRIBUTES  <br>DO YOU WANT TO USE THE SCREEN-MODE VERSION? Yes// <b></b>  (Yes)<br><br>MODIFY WHAT FILE: ORDER// <b></b>
  

Select FIELD: <b>FLAGGED</b></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>You will then be taken into a ScreenMan form where you can edit the
		properties of the field, as shown below:</p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <center>
		<img src="Setfld.jpg" alt="Example of a SET OF CODES DATA TYPE in Screen Mode." height="455" width="640"> </center> 
	  
	 <p>In Screen Mode, whenever the DATA TYPE field is editable, a "pop-up"
		window appears, containing editable attributes of the field that are pertinent
		to its specific Data Type. SET OF CODES-type fields require input of all the
		allowable "Internal" values (i.e., "CODE" prompt), and their "External"
		equivalents (i.e., "WILL STAND FOR" prompt).</p> 
	 <p>Using the <b>&lt;ArrowUp&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;ArrowDown&gt;</b> keys makes
		it easy to edit the codes. It is permissible to leave a blank row, but every
		Internal Code (i.e., "CODE," on the left) must have a corresponding External
		Code ("WILL STAND FOR," on the right), and vice versa.</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="Free_text">FREE TEXT Field</a></h5> 
	 <p>In the following example, the DATA TYPE field for the REASON FOR FLAG
		field (#.67) in the ORDER file (#100) has a value of FREE TEXT:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select OPTION: <b>MOD</b>IFY FILE ATTRIBUTES  <br>DO YOU WANT TO USE THE SCREEN-MODE VERSION? Yes// <b></b>  (Yes)<br><br>MODIFY WHAT FILE: ORDER// <b></b> <br><br> <br>Select FIELD: <b>REASON FOR FLAG</b> </pre> <hr> 
	 <p>You will then be taken into a ScreenMan form where you can edit the
		properties of the field, as shown below:</p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <center>
		<img src="Freefld.jpg" alt="Example of a FREE TEXT DATA TYPE in Screen Mode." height="455" width="640"> </center> 
	  
	 <p>In Screen Mode, whenever the DATA TYPE field is editable, a "pop-up"
		window appears, containing editable attributes of the field that are pertinent
		to its specific Data Type. FREE TEXT-type fields require input for the
		"MINIMUM" and "MAXIMUM" lengths of the field. In this example, users must enter
		from 1 to 80 characters for this field.</p> 
	 <p>If included, the PATTERN MATCH must be written in M. For example, you
		can insure that the data value will not start with a punctuation character by
		entering a PATTERN MATCH of "<b>X'?1P.E</b>". This is a good check to make on a
		field that is allowed to be just one character in length. Sometimes, users may
		mistype and answer a field prompt with "<b>/</b>" (same key as "<b>?</b>") or
		some other meaningless punctuation character. A PATTERN MATCH check such as
		"<b>X'?1P.E</b>" will keep that kind of mistake out of your database.</p>
	 <hr size="8"> 
	 <h5><a name="Word">WORD-PROCESSING Field</a></h5> 
	 <p>In the following example, the DATA TYPE field for the ORDER TEXT field
		(#.11) in the ORDER file (#100) has a value of WORD-PROCESSING:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select OPTION: <b>MOD</b>IFY FILE ATTRIBUTES  <br>DO YOU WANT TO USE THE SCREEN-MODE VERSION? Yes// <b></b>  (Yes)<br> <br>MODIFY WHAT FILE: ORDER// <b></b>
 

Select FIELD: <b>ORDER TEXT</b></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>You will then be taken into a ScreenMan form where you can edit the
		properties of the field, as shown below:</p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <center>
		<img src="Wpfld.jpg" alt="Example of a WORD-PROCESSING DATA TYPE in Screen Mode." height="455" width="640"> </center> 
	  
	 <p>In Screen Mode, whenever the DATA TYPE field is editable, a "pop-up"
		window appears, containing editable attributes of the field that are pertinent
		to its specific DATA TYPE. With WORD-PROCESSING-type fields VA FileMan asks
		only one question in the "pop-up" window (i.e., "SHALL THIS TEXT NORMALLY
		APPEAR IN WORD-WRAP MODE"). If you answer YES to this question, text is
		automatically wrapped at word boundaries to fit in the column in which it is
		being printed.</p> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> When it is important that lines of text be printed exactly
		as they were entered, answer NO to the "SHALL THIS TEXT NORMALLY APPEAR IN
		WORD-WRAP MODE" question.</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="Computed">COMPUTED Field</a></h5> 
	 <p>In the following example, the DATA TYPE field for the JUST RELEASED
		field (#1000) in the ORDER file (#100) has a value of COMPUTED:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select OPTION: <b>MOD</b>IFY FILE ATTRIBUTES  <br>DO YOU WANT TO USE THE SCREEN-MODE VERSION? Yes// <b></b>  (Yes)<br> <br>MODIFY WHAT FILE: ORDER// <b></b>
 

Select FIELD: <b>JUST RELEASED</b></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>You will then be taken into a ScreenMan form where you can edit the
		properties of the field, as shown below:</p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <center>
		<img src="Compfld.jpg" alt="Example of a COMPUTED DATA TYPE in Screen Mode." height="455" width="640"> </center> 
	  
	 <p>In Screen Mode, whenever the DATA TYPE field is editable, a "pop-up"
		window appears, containing editable attributes of the field that are pertinent
		to its specific Data Type. With COMPUTED-type fields VA FileMan displays the
		characteristics of the computed expression in the "pop-up" window. The syntax
		of these expressions is explained fully in the "<a href="ce_frm.htm" target="_top" title="Computed Expressions" class="bodylink">Computed
		Expressions</a>" chapter. Field #.68 is the
		<a href="#Date/Time" title="RELEASE DATE/TIME" class="bodylink">RELEASE
		DATE/TIME</a> field. The JUST RELEASED field will be TRUE if the
		<a href="#Date/Time" title="RELEASE DATE/TIME" class="bodylink">RELEASE
		DATE/TIME</a> was less than two days ago. </p> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> We can specify this virtual value to be BOOLEAN,
		STRING-VALUED, DATE-VALUED, or NUMERIC. Only in the last case are the three
		fields following the "TYPE OF RESULT" prompt editable. </p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="Pointer">POINTER TO A FILE Field</a></h5> 
	 <p>In the following example, the DATA TYPE field for the WHO ENTERED field
		(#3) in the ORDER file (#100) has a value of POINTER TO A FILE:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select OPTION: <b>MOD</b>IFY FILE ATTRIBUTES  <br>DO YOU WANT TO USE THE SCREEN-MODE VERSION? Yes// <b></b>  (Yes)<br> <br>MODIFY WHAT FILE: ORDER// <b></b>
 
 
Select FIELD: <b>WHO ENTERED</b></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>You will then be taken into a ScreenMan form where you can edit the
		properties of the field, as shown below:</p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <center>
		<img src="Pointfld.jpg" alt="Example of a POINTER TO A FILE DATA TYPE in Screen Mode." height="455" width="640"> </center> 
	  
	 <p>In Screen Mode, whenever the DATA TYPE field is editable, a "pop-up"
		window appears, containing editable attributes of the field that are pertinent
		to its specific Data Type. With POINTER TO A FILE-type fields VA FileMan asks
		you to enter the pointed-to file name in the "pop-up" window. The file that is
		pointed to (in this case, the NEW PERSON file) must already exist on your
		system. If you enter a <b>?</b> (single question mark) at this prompt, you will
		be presented with a list of the available files from which you can choose.</p> 
	 <p>By answering NO to the "LAYGO" question, you insure that users who are
		editing the "WHO ENTERED" data are not able to add a new entry on the fly to
		the NEW PERSON file. </p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="Variable">VARIABLE-POINTER Field</a></h5> 
	 <p>In the following example, the DATA TYPE field for the ITEM ORDERED field
		(#7) in the ORDER file (#100) has a value of VARIABLE-POINTER:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select OPTION: <b>MOD</b>IFY FILE ATTRIBUTES  <br>DO YOU WANT TO USE THE SCREEN-MODE VERSION? Yes// <b></b>  (Yes)<br> <br>MODIFY WHAT FILE: ORDER// <b></b>
 

Select FIELD: <b>ITEM ORDERED</b></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>You will then be taken into a ScreenMan form where you can edit the
		properties of the field, as shown below:</p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <center>
		<img src="Varfld.jpg" alt="Example of a VARIABLE-POINTER DATA TYPE in Screen Mode." height="455" width="640"> </center> 
	  
	 <p>In Screen Mode, whenever the DATA TYPE field is editable, a "pop-up"
		window appears, containing editable attributes of the field that are pertinent
		to its specific Data Type. With VARIABLE-POINTER-type fields VA FileMan asks
		you to enter the pointed-to file name and its order in the first "pop-up"
		window. In this case, the first VARIABLE-POINTER file entered was the OPTION
		file, which would already have to exist. The ORDER was also set to one. When
		you press the Enter/Return key at the "ORDER" prompt for each VARIABLE-POINTER,
		there is an additional "pop-up" window (i.e., a "pop-up window within the
		pop-up window"). The additional questions pertaining to the VARIABLE-POINTER
		file you are currently entering will appear in this secondary "pop-up"
		window.</p> 
	 <p>As you can see in this example, the OPTION file's MESSAGE, is associated
		with "PROTOCOL." Since its ORDER is one, it is the first file searched. The
		PREFIX "MISC" can also be used to refer to the OPTION file. Just as with the
		<a href="#Pointer" title="WHO ENTERED" class="bodylink">WHO ENTERED</a> POINTER
		TO A FILE field (previously described), users cannot add new options to the
		OPTION file on the fly when they are entering an ITEM ORDERED in the ORDER file
		because the "SHOULD USER BE ALLOWED TO ADD A NEW ENTRY:" prompt is NO.</p> <hr>
	 
	 <h5><a name="Multiple">Creating a Multiple</a></h5> 
	 <p>The following example illustrates creating a Multiple field. For this
		example, we will simulate creating the RESPONSES field (#4.5) in the ORDER file
		(#100). It has a Data Type of NUMERIC:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select OPTION: <b>MOD</b>IFY FILE ATTRIBUTES  <br>DO YOU WANT TO USE THE SCREEN-MODE VERSION? Yes// <b></b>  (Yes)<br> <br>MODIFY WHAT FILE: ORDER// <b></b>
 

Select FIELD: <b>RESPONSES</b>
  Are you adding 'RESPONSES' as a new FIELD? No// <b>Y </b>  (Yes)<br>  FIELD NUMBER: 4.5// <b></b> <br><br></pre> <hr> 
	 <p>You will then be taken into a ScreenMan form where you can edit the
		properties of the field, as shown below:</p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <center>
		<img src="Newmul.jpg" alt="Example of Creating a Multiple in Screen Mode." height="455" width="640"> </center> 
	  
	 <p>A Multiple field is created just as any other, except that the "IS THIS
		FIELD MULTIPLE..." question is answered YES. In Screen Mode, after answering
		YES to this question, a "pop-up" window appears containing editable attributes
		pertinent to a Multiple field. With Multiple-type fields, VA FileMan asks if
		you want users to be notified when they are adding new entries and if users
		should be asked if they want to make another entry. In this case, we answered
		NO to both questions.</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="Subfields">Subfields</a></h5> 
	 <p>To create or edit Subfields of a Multiple field, select a
		Multiple-valued field (e.g., the
		<a href="#Multiple" title="RESPONSES" class="bodylink">RESPONSES</a> Multiple
		field, previously created):</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select OPTION: <b>MOD</b>IFY FILE ATTRIBUTES  <br>DO YOU WANT TO USE THE SCREEN-MODE VERSION? Yes// <b></b>  (Yes)<br> <br>MODIFY WHAT FILE: ORDER// <b></b>
 

Select FIELD: <b>RESPONSES</b>  (multiple) </pre> <hr> 
	 <p>You will then be taken into a ScreenMan form where you can edit the
		properties of the field, as shown below:</p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <center>
		<img src="Mulfld.jpg" alt="Example of a Multiple Field in Screen Mode." height="455" width="640"> </center> 
	  
	 <p>In Screen Mode, after entering a Multiple field, a special screen
		appears that displays information about the Multiple <i>as a whole</i>. </p> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> If you wanted to delete <i>the entire Multiple field</i>,
		you would enter an at-sign ("<b>@</b>") at the "MULTIPLE-FIELD LABEL"
		prompt.</p> 
	 <p>After viewing this screen, you can proceed to add fields to the Multiple
		or to edit existing <b><a href="#Numeric" title="Subfields" class="bodylink">Subfields</a></b>. This is done at the "Select SUB-FIELD:"
		prompt that is displayed when you exit Screen Mode (shown below).</p> <hr> 
	 <h5><a name="Numeric">Numeric Subfield</a></h5> 
	 <p>After selecting a Multiple-valued field (e.g., the
		<a href="#Multiple" title="RESPONSES" class="bodylink">RESPONSES</a> Multiple
		field in the ORDER file), you can enter or modify the Multiple's subfields by
		entering the field's number or name (label) at the "Select xxxxxxx SUB-FIELD:"
		prompt (where xxxxxxx represents the name of the Multiple).</p> 
	 <p> A .01 field with the same name as the Multiple field was added
		automatically when the field was identified as a Multiple. The .01 field is the
		identifying key for an entry in the Subfile (Multiple); it is similar to a
		file's .01 field, which is the file's identifying key. In the following
		example, the .01 subfield is edited to have a Data Type of NUMERIC:</p> 
	  
	 <pre>Select RESPONSES SUB-FIELD: <b>.01 </b>  ITEM ENTRY   </pre> <hr> 
	 <p>You will then be taken into a ScreenMan form where you can edit the
		properties of the subfield, as shown below:</p> 
	 <p></p> 
	 <center>
		<img src="Numfld.jpg" alt="Example of a NUMERIC DATA TYPE in Screen Mode." height="455" width="640"> </center> 
	  
	 <p>In Screen Mode, while editing a sub-field of a Multiple, you will notice
		that the heading at the top of the screen reminds you that you are now editing
		a field <i>within a Multiple</i> (e.g., "Field #.01 in Sub-File #100.045 of
		File #100").</p> 
	 <p>Also, whenever the DATA TYPE field is editable, a "pop-up" window
		appears, containing editable attributes of the field that are pertinent to its
		specific Data Type. With NUMERIC-type fields VA FileMan asks you to enter the
		"INCLUSIVE LOWER BOUND" (e.g., set to 1) and the "INCLUSIVE UPPER BOUND (e.g.,
		set to 9999999). In addition, you are asked if the numeric value is a dollar
		amount and if decimal digits will be allowed (i.e., the "MAXIMUM NUMBER OF
		FRACTIONAL DIGITS"). </p> 
	 <p>A default Help prompt is automatically written for you with the NUMERIC
		Data Type. In this case, the English message "Type a Number between 1 and
		9999999, 0 Decimal Digits" has been built automatically from the
		specifications. As always, you can accept the default Help prompt or change it
		using the Replace ... With syntax.</p> 
	 <p><b>NOTE:</b> This Help information is displayed when the user inputs a
		single question mark ("<b>?</b>") when editing this field.</p>
