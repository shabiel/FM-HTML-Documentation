	 <H4>Select Entries to Archive </H4> 
	 <P>The Select Entries to Archive option creates the archiving activity. It
		is used similarly to the Search File Entries option. The Select Entries to
		Archive option is the first step in developing an archiving activity and is
		very important since there cannot be any archiving without the SEARCH template
		created in this option. </P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> It's important to know which entries you want archived and
		where you want them stored before you start the archiving process! </P> 
	 <P>This mandatory archiving option really performs three important
		functions: </P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>A search for file entries that meet your specified search criteria or
		  condition (truth test) occurs first. The results of this search are then stored
		  in a template you specify. You must store these results in a template! (For
		  guidance on how to use the search option procedures, please refer to the "<A
		  HREF="../u1/sr_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" TITLE="Search"
		  CLASS="bodylink">Search</A>" chapter in the "<A HREF="../u1/index.htm"
		  TARGET="_top" TITLE="VA FileMan V. 22.0 Getting Started HTML Manual"
		  CLASS="bodylink">VA FileMan Getting Started Manual</A>.")<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>After storing the results of the search in a template, a sort of the
		  file by any field must occur. This sort is as important as the search portion
		  of this option! Do not use any sort criteria that contains M code. Be careful,
		  if you limit the sort range, you will limit the entries selected for archiving.
		  You can delete unwanted entries later by using the Add/Delete Selected Entries
		  option.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Finally, a print of the fields to be archived to a printer or the
		  screen (CRT) must occur. Printing fields that uniquely identify the entries
		  being archived gives you a permanent record of the archived entries.</LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P>You <I>cannot</I> create an archiving activity until <I>at least one</I>
		entry is located according to your search criteria, sorted, and printed to a
		printer or a terminal! </P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE:</B> If a subentry to be archived is contained in a Multiple
		field, the entire entry must be archived. </P> 
	 <P>An example of the dialogue you may encounter follows. Notice the
		sequence of search, sort, and print:</P> 
	  
	 <PRE>ARCHIVE FROM WHAT FILE: <B>CHANGE</B>

  -A- SEARCH FOR CHANGE FIELD: <B>.01	</B>  NO.
  -A- CONDITION: <B>LESS THAN</B>
  -A- LESS THAN: <B>900</B>  

  -B- SEARCH FOR CHANGE FIELD: <B></B>

  IF:  A// <B></B>	 NO. LESS THAN 900

STORE RESULTS OF SEARCH IN TEMPLATE: <B>ZZTEST TEMPLATE</B>
 Are you adding 'ZZTEST TEMPLATE' as a new SORT TEMPLATE?  No// <B>Y </B>  (Yes)

SORT BY: <B>VERSION</B>
START WITH VERSION:  FIRST// <B></B>
  WITHIN VERSION, SORT BY: <B></B>

FIRST PRINT FIELD: <B>.01 </B>  NO.
THEN PRINT FIELD: <B>VERSION</B>
THEN PRINT FIELD: <B>PROGRAMMER</B>
THEN PRINT FIELD: <B></B>
HEADING:  CHANGE ARCHIVE SEARCH  Replace <B></B> 
DEVICE: <B></B>

	 <P>After using this option, the status of your archiving activity is
		SELECTED. The status of an archiving activity can be SELECTED, EDITED, ARCHIVED
		(TEMPORARY), ARCHIVED (PERMANENT), or PURGED. You may identify a file at the
		"ARCHIVE FROM WHAT FILE:" prompt and get the response that follows: </P> 
	 <PRE>    There is already an outstanding <I>archiving</I> activity.
    Please finish it or CANCEL it.</PRE> 
	 <P>This message means that the file you identified has already been
		selected for archiving and that archiving activity has not been completed; a
		second one cannot be started yet. Since the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY file is being
		shared by both archiving and
		<A HREF="ex_intro.htm" TITLE="extract" CLASS="bodylink">extract</A> activities,
		the italicized word in the message will say <I>extract</I> if the outstanding
		activity on the file identified is an extract. </P> <P>&nbsp;</P>
