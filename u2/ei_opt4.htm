	 <P>In the final step to export data, use the Export Data option to select
		which entries from the file to export, and then perform the export.</P> 
	 <P>First, choose which entries to export with a "SEARCH" dialogue; then

		given the "SORT BY" dialogue, if you are exporting fields from Subfiles.)
		Finally, specify the device to send the exported data to. </P> 
	 <P>During either the Search or Sort process, you can use previously created
		SEARCH and SORT templates. Those templates need not have been originally made
		during a data export; however, SORT templates that contain unacceptable
		qualifiers should not be used. At the "SORT BY:" prompt, you can only use the
		following subset of sort qualifiers:</P>

	 <H5>Export Example</H5> 
	 <P>Here is an example of an export using the "PATIENT TO 123" EXPORT
		template created in
		<A HREF="ei_opt3.htm" TITLE="Steop 3: Create Export Template Option"
		CLASS="bodylink">Step 3</A>. You begin by identifying the file and the EXPORT
		template that you want to use for the export. Do <I>not</I> enclose the
		template's name with brackets. Again, you can delete the EXPORT template after
		a successful export, if you want. </P> 
	 <P>Because there is a Multiple involved, you are told that you will not
		have the opportunity to sort. Then, you are given the opportunity to search the
		file for entries to export. </P> 
	 <PRE>
</PRE> <HR> 
	 <PRE>Select DATA EXPORT TO FOREIGN FORMAT OPTION: <B>EXPORT DATA</B>

OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: PATIENT// <B></B>

Choose an EXPORT template: <B>PATIENT TO 123 </B>    **EXPORT**
                         (OCT 30, 1992@15:08) USER #7  FILE #99002
 

Do you want to delete the PATIENT TO 123 template
after the data export is complete?
Enter Yes or No: NO// <B></B>

Since you are exporting fields from multiples,
a sort will be done automatically.
You will not have the opportunity to sort the data before export.

Do you want to SEARCH for entries to be exported? NO// <B>YES</B>

  -A- SEARCH FOR PATIENT FIELD: <B>DATE OF BIRTH</B>  
  -A- CONDITION: <B>&lt; </B>  LESS THAN
  -A- LESS THAN DATE: <B>1980 </B>  (1980)

  -B- SEARCH FOR PATIENT FIELD: <B></B>

IF: A// <B></B>  DATE OF BIRTH LESS THAN 1980 (1980)

STORE RESULTS OF SEARCH IN TEMPLATE: <B></B>
</PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>If Multiples had not been involved, you would now be able to respond to
		the SORT BY dialogue. You can do the same things with sort here that you can do
		when using the Print File Entries option. </P> <HR> 
	 <H5>What Device to Send Export Data To</H5> 
	 <P>After you complete the sort dialogue, you are immediately given the
		"DEVICE:" prompt. Choose what device the exported data should be sent to:</P> 
	 <PRE>    DEVICE: <B></B></PRE> 
	 <P>If you press the Enter/Return key at the "DEVICE:" prompt, the export
		output will be displayed on your <I>screen</I>. Sending the formatted export
		data to the screen allows you to use a PC-based screen capture to put the data
		into a file. This file would be a readable ASCII file on that computer. This
		method of transferring the data into a file is a simple one that will often be
		successful and convenient, especially if the importing application is on the
		same PC. </P> 
	 <P>When using a screen capture to create a file from the exported data, you
		must consider the peculiarities of your communication and terminal emulation
		software. Your communication application, for example, may intercept certain
		control characters (like the <B>&lt;TAB&gt;</B>, ASCII 9) and convert them into
		something else. This may cause the import to fail. Also, your terminal
		emulation may automatically "break" lines at 80 characters by inserting an
		unwanted carriage return or line feed. When emulating VT-100 and other ANSI
		terminals, you can avoid this last problem by turning wraparound mode off. </P>
	 
	 <P><B>CAUTION:</B> When exporting data to your terminal's screen, there
		will be no page breaks. Therefore, there is no graceful way to interrupt the
		export once it has begun. </P> <HR> 
	 <H5>Sending Export Data to a Host File</H5> 
	 <P>Having data printed on-screen is of little use, if you are using a
		terminal with no screen-capture capabilities. An alternative is to send the
		data to a file on the host system, for example, to a VMS file if you are using
		DSM. Another advantage to sending data to a Host file is that only the exported
		data will be in the file. (Often, screen captures will unavoidably contain
		extraneous parts of the user's dialogue prior to or after the export.) To
		export your data to a file, at the "DEVICE:" prompt, send your export output to
		an HFS-type device. </P> 
	 <P>Your IRM should be able to help you, if you're not sure how to use HFS
		devices. The "Kernel Systems Manual" also describes how to send output to Host
		files, including how to set up and use HFS-type devices. </P> 
	 <P>When a Host file is created, you must move that ASCII file to the
		computer on which the importing application resides. A file transfer protocol,
		such as KERMIT or XMODEM, can be used to move this file. </P> 
	 <P>The export can be queued, if it is not sent to the screen. Queuing the
		export is recommended for large files and for complex sorts of the data. </P> 
	 <P><B>NOTE -- On HFS Device Setup on OpenVMS Systems:</B> DSM for OpenVMS
		requires that you add a command parameter to the OPEN command, if you export
		records longer than 512 characters to a Host file. The parameter is
		RECORDSIZE=nnnn, where "nnnn" is greater than the longest record that you are
		exporting. If you are using Kernel's DEVICE file (#3.5), the OPEN PARAMETER
		field for the HFS device you are using should be edited to look like
		"(NEW:RECORDSIZE=nnnn)". </P> <HR> 
	 <H5>Sample Output</H5> 
	 <P>The data below has been prepared for import by Lotus 1-2-3, so it need
		not be easily read by people. However, you can see that text fields are
		surrounded by quotes; empty text fields consist just of two quotes (<B>""</B>).
		A space is in between each field's value. Numeric values have no quotes. If a
		field defined as numeric in the VA FileMan data dictionary has no value, a zero
		(0) is output because this format has
		<A HREF="ei_sig.htm#Substitute_for_null" TITLE="SUBSTITUTE FOR NULL"
		CLASS="bodylink">SUBSTITUTE FOR NULL</A> set to "0". <BR> </P>
