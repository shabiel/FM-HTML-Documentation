	 <P>The Edit File option available on the VA FileMan Utility Functions
		submenu displays the various attributes of a file you specify in Screen Mode

	 <P>Here is an example using the Edit File option with the ORDER file (#100)
		in Screen Mode:</P> 
	  
	 <PRE>Select Utility Functions Option: <B>edit</B> File

MODIFY WHAT FILE: ORDER// <B></B></PRE> <HR> 
	 <P>You will then be taken into a ScreenMan form where you can edit the
		properties of the file, as shown below:</P>

		 ALT="ScreenMan Form where you can edit the properties of a file." WIDTH="640"
		 HEIGHT="455"> </CENTER> 
	 <P></P> 
	  
	 <P>You can use this option to:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><B>Edit the Name of a File --</B> Edit the file name at the "FILE
		  NAME:" prompt. <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Delete a File --</B> If you enter an at-sign ("<B>@</B>") at the
		  "FILE NAME:" prompt, you are given the choice of deleting the <B><I>entire
		  file</I></B> and its data attribute dictionary (including all of its templates
		  and file definitions) or just deleting the <B><I>current individual entries in
		  the file</I></B>. However, you <I>cannot</I> delete a file that is pointed to
		  by another file. <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Enter or Edit the Description of a File --</B> You can enter or
		  edit the word processing text description for documenting the file at the
		  "DESCRIPTION..." prompt. This description appears in the Standard, Modified
		  Standard, and Global Map format data dictionary listings. <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Enter or Edit the Application Group --</B> You can enter or edit
		  the Application Group at the "Select APPLICATION GROUP:" prompt. Enter a
		  namespace (from two to four characters) indicating a package accessing this
		  file. <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Enter or Edit the Developer's Name --</B> You can enter or edit
		  the name of the package developer at the "DEVELOPER:" prompt. Entering two
		  question marks ("<B>??</B>") lets you choose from a list of names. <BR> <BR>
		  </LI> 
		<LI><B>Enter or Edit the File Access Parameters --</B> You can enter or
		  edit the security access to a file by making entries at the "DATA DICTIONARY
		  ACCESS:", "READ ACCESS:", "WRITE ACCESS:", "DELETE ACCESS:", "LAYGO ACCESS:",
		  and/or "AUDIT ACCESS:" prompts. File security is fully explained in the "<A
		  HREF="ds_frm.htm" TARGET="_top" CLASS="bodylink" TITLE="Data Security">Data
		  Security</A>" chapter. <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Turn Auditing On/Off for a File's Data Dictionary --</B> If you
		  want to turn auditing on for data dictionary changes, enter YES at the "DD
		  AUDIT:" prompt. Answer NO, if you don't want to audit data dictionary changes.
		  This is fully explained in the "<A HREF="au_frm.htm" TARGET="_top"
		  TITLE="Auditing" CLASS="bodylink">Auditing</A>" chapter.</LI> 
		<LI><B>Ask/Don't Ask Users to Confirm Their Entry Selection --</B> If you
		  want users who select an entry in a file (for any lookup purpose) to confirm
		  their entry selection by answering positively at the "&#133;OK?" prompt, answer
		  YES at the "ASK 'OK' WHEN LOOKING UP AN ENTRY:" prompt. <BR> <BR> <B>NOTE:</B>
		  This feature can be helpful on files containing many similar or confusingly
		  named entries (e.g., files for drugs). <BR> <BR> If you don't want users to
		  confirm their entry selection, answer NO at the "ASK 'OK' WHEN LOOKING UP AN
		  ENTRY:" prompt. The default is NO. <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Enter or Edit a Post-Selection Action (only available when you
		  have programmer access) --</B> If you have programmer access, you can write M
		  code for a
		  <A HREF="../pm/afd_10.htm" TITLE="Post-Selection Action"
		  CLASS="bodylink">Post-Selection Action</A>, for entries in this file. This is
		  explained in the "<A HREF="../pm/index.htm" TARGET="_top"
		  TITLE="VA FileMan V. 22.0 Programmer HTML Manual" CLASS="bodylink">VA FileMan
		  Programmer Manual</A>." <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Enter a Lookup Routine (only available when you have programmer
		  access) --</B> If you have programmer access, you also can enter an existing
		  lookup routine. To do this, enter a routine namespace (from three to six
		  characters, no "<B>^</B>") at the "LOOK-UP PROGRAM:" prompt. The name you
		  choose for the lookup routine must be a routine currently on the system. This
		  special lookup routine will be executed instead of the standard VA FileMan
		  lookup logic, whenever a call is made to ^DIC. <BR> <BR> </LI> 
		<LI><B>Specify that Cross-references on a File Should be Compiled (only
		  available when you have programmer access) --</B> If you have programmer
		  access, you also can specify that cross-references on a file should be
		  compiled. To do this, enter a routine namespace (from three to six characters,
		  no "<B>^</B>") at the "CROSS-REFERENCE ROUTINE:" prompt. This will become the
		  namespace of the compiled routine(s). If a <I>new</I> routine name is entered,
		  but the cross-references are not compiled at this time, the routine name will
		  be automatically deleted. <BR> <BR> To <B>stop</B> the use of the compiled
		  cross-references, enter an at-sign ("<B>@</B>") at the "CROSS-REFERENCE
		  ROUTINE:" prompt. At this point, the cross-references are considered
		  uncompiled, and VA FileMan will not use the routine for re-indexing. If you
		  decide later to recompile the cross-references, you will be shown the routine
		  name previously used so that you can easily reuse the same routine name.
		  Stopping the use of the compiled cross-reference does <I>not</I> delete the
		  compiled routines. If you want, you can delete those routines manually.</LI>
