	 <H4>Considerations Before Archiving</H4> 
	 <P>The following summarizes some of the important items to note regarding
		the archiving facility. Consider them before you begin archiving:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>We strongly encourage you to have a current backup of your files
		  before archiving.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Archiving is not user-specific. In other words, archiving is attached
		  to a file not a user. For your own protection, please be aware that someone
		  other than yourself can complete or change an existing archiving activity.
		  <BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Data from logical and physical files can be archived, but only the
		  data from the physical (primary) file can be purged (removed).<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>VA FileMan must be able to collect and print the data (using the
		  search criteria) before you can create an archiving activity. That is, the
		  Select Entries to Archive option must be run to completion such that the
		  selected entries are printed (and can thus be stored in the ^DIBT SORT TEMPLATE
		  global).<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>If you plan to keep a hard copy of the printed entries for future
		  reference, design your PRINT template to facilitate review. You do not need to
		  print all of the fields' values that will be archived, but you may want to
		  include those that, in combination, will uniquely identify the entry. Save the
		  PRINT template for future use when archiving. <BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>When the archived entries are written to temporary storage, the
		  corresponding original entry disappears from the user's view. (A new node,
		  subscripted with -9, is added to the original entry so that it will be bypassed
		  by the usual VA FileMan calls.)<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>If data to be archived is contained in a Multiple field, then the
		  entire entry must be archived. You cannot archive a subentry by
		  itself.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>A FILEGRAM-type template is the only template type allowed in the
		  Write Entries to Temporary Storage option.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>You cannot have more than one archiving activity on a file at a
		  time.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Data selected for archiving can be permanently saved to any
		  <B>sequential</B> storage media, for example: SDP, a VMS file, magnetic tape,
		  or a removable disk pack.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>Depending on the number of entries involved, be prepared for the
		  search (the Select Entries to Archive option) and write (the Write Entries to
		  Temporary Storage option) processes to be time-consuming.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>A brief history of who performed the various archive steps and when
		  they were accomplished is saved in the
		  <A HREF="ar_aa.htm" TITLE="ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY file" CLASS="bodylink">ARCHIVAL
		  ACTIVITY file</A>.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>You can cancel your archiving process, by using the Cancel Archival
		  Selection option, at any time before the Purge Stored Entries option is
		  used.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>The Find Archived Entries option can be used to verify that the
		  archive medium contains all the information intended to be
		  archived.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>The Purge Stored Entries option completely deletes data from the file
		  being archived and from the
		  <A HREF="ar_aa.htm" CLASS="bodylink" TITLE="ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY file">ARCHIVAL
		  ACTIVITY file</A>.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>You cannot purge archived entries until you have moved selected
		  entries to permanent storage. Thus, you need not worry about losing entries
		  before they're archived.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI>You cannot start a second archive from a file until you purge or
		  cancel the existing archiving activity on that file. </LI>
